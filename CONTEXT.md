## Product

Semper is an Android app that measures **how a surface deforms** from photographs.
A specimen is painted with random speckle; one **reference** image and one or more
**deformed** frames go through an on-device C++ engine. Output is a full-field
**displacement** (U, V, ~1/100 px) and **strain** (Exx, Eyy, Exy) as interactive
heatmaps, PDF, CSV, and PNG.

Analysis is **offline**. Cloud (Firebase Auth → Cloud Run → Firestore → Drive) is
optional identity, metadata, and blob sync. Bytes never transit Cloud Run; the
phone PUTs to a Drive resumable URI. No JSON service-account keys.

## Domain terms

Use these words. Do not invent synonyms.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| subset | Odd-width pixel window tracked around its center (default ~41 px) |
| step | Grid spacing between tracked points, px |
| ZNSSD | Match score; 0 = perfect, ≤ 0.15 accepted, < 0 failed-point sentinel |
| ICGN | Iterative Gauss-Newton sub-pixel solver |
| VSG | Strain window: least-squares plane fit, odd width |
| `.dat` | Binary field: 8 floats/point (`x y u v exx eyy exy znssd`), 32 bytes |
| session | One saved analysis on disk (and optionally in the cloud) |

Engine pipeline (detail in `native/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`): AKAZE seeds → Delaunay
mesh → RGDIC flood-fill → ICGN → VSG strain → `.dat`.

## Layout

```
app/          Android UI + JNI adapter (`app/src/main/cpp/`)
native/       Pinned submodule: semperdic/semper-dic-engine (solver, tests, docs)
backend/      FastAPI on Cloud Run — routers in backend/app/routers/
firebase-hosting/  Auth continue URLs, asset links, generated legal pages
docs/         Human docs. This file is the agent map.
```

The engine is **not** in this repo. Bump it by changing the `native` gitlink.
Engine host / sanitizer / DICe suites run in the engine repo. This CI only proves
the pin still **links** (emulator x86_64, release arm64).

## Runtime

```
Splash → Auth / Pending / Home
Home → StaticAnalysisActivity (wizard) → ResultViewerActivity
     → open session → ResultViewerActivity | VsgLatticeActivity
```

Access routing is `AccessRouter` + `AccessStatus`. Intent extras are `DicKeys`.
Session dirs: `SessionStore` + `SessionPaths` (`raw_deformed/`, `frame_%04d.dat`).

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `ui/analysis/` | Wizard, ROI, import, VSG sweep, batch run |
| `ui/viewer/` | Heatmaps, probe, `ShareCenter` |
| `ui/settings/` | `SettingsActivity` + `Settings*Section` |
| `ui/home/` | Session list |
| `ui/common/` | Insets, `MediaPickerSheet`, `CrispToast`, `TransferBannerController` |
| `ui/capture/` | Home Record: setup, test shot, contrast ROI, AF lock, timed capture |
| `data/` | Auth, session store, upload/restore/download workers, storage budget |
| `analytics/` | `SemperAnalytics` — consent-gated events, same flag as Crashlytics |
| `report/` | PDF / CSV / `VisualizationEngine` |
| `backend/app/main.py` | App, middleware, lifespan |
| `backend/app/routers/` | `/v1/*` by prefix: health, account, devices, sessions, files, provision_tasks, admin |
| `backend/app/session_provision.py` | `provision_session` / `purge_session` |

Kotlin helpers are plain `object` / small classes (`*Helper`, `*Runner`, `*Bundler`).
No Hilt/Dagger. Keep `lifecycleScope` and Activity Result launchers on the Activity.

Wizard later steps inflate through **ViewStubs**. `goToStep` stays on
`StaticAnalysisActivity`. Slot chrome / coach marks: `AnalysisWizardSlots` /
`AnalysisWizardCoach`.

Full-field batch: `DicBatchRunner` + `DicFieldIo` shared with VSG. JNI
`computeFullFieldDirect` stays **inside that one loop**.

New analysis starts from the Home FAB menu: **Import** opens `MediaPickerSheet`
(shared with wizard dropzones); **Record** runs the capture flow in `ui/capture/`.
Long transfers show a
non-modal `TransferBannerController` strip in Settings and the viewer; uploads,
restores, `DicBundleDownloadWorker` downloads and backup deletes are WorkManager.

## Invariants

- **Bit-exact fields.** Do not change `.dat` packing, ZNSSD threshold, or DatCodec
  oracles unless the engine contract major-bumps. GIF bytes are pinned 0-delta.
- **JNI buffer is bounded.** Allocate to the ROI grid; a point count over capacity
  is an engine failure, never a read past the buffer.
- **Do not split** VisualizationEngine loops, GifEncoder LZW, ReportBuilder fusion,
  `DicResult.decodeDatFile`, `DicUploadWorker.doWork`, `prefetchAround` /
  `ScrubFrameCache`, `PointSpatialIndex.build`.
- **Scrub cache** is byte-bounded and filled by **one** serialized worker.
- **Whole-batch** summary / spatial index start on demand, never on viewer open.
- **Batch progress** is a buffered `SharedFlow` (`DROP_OLDEST`), not a `StateFlow`.
- **Cancel sweep** abandons the sweep (check between combinations).
- **Drive unknown ≠ deleted.** Drop local metadata only when the backend confirms
  a blob is missing.
- **Storage reclaim** frees local frames of **backed-up** sessions only.
- **Analytics and crash reporting share one consent flag** (`DicSettings.diagnosticsEnabled`).
  Events stay PII-free — buckets and enums only, never images, results, session ids
  or specimen names.
- **Release** builds require HTTPS `INDIC_API_BASE_URL`. Debug emulator boots
  local-only unless `INDIC_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false`.
- **Legal pages** are generated: edit `docs/legal/`, run `scripts/render_legal_pages.py`,
  never hand-edit `firebase-hosting/public/{privacy,terms}/`.
- **Image installs `requirements.lock`** with `--require-hashes`. Bump txt and
  regenerate the lock on **Python 3.12**. CI checks versions, not just names.

## Quality gates

Empty `app/lint-baseline.xml` and `app/detekt-baseline.xml`. Prefer a targeted
`@file:Suppress` or an extract over stuffing a baseline.

Open lint warnings (leave them): `OldTargetApi` (`compileSdk` 37 / `targetSdk` 36),
`TooManyViews` on `activity_settings.xml`. Do not bump `targetSdk` or turn on
`warningsAsErrors` in a drive-by.

Kover `minBound` floor is 15. Macrobenchmark CI is emulator **smoke**
(`suppressErrors=EMULATOR,LOW-BATTERY,UNLOCKED`), API 34, no numeric thresholds.

Engine perf floor: [docs/engine/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md](docs/engine/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md)
(≥ 4557 solves/s host). Preserve `-O3 -ffast-math` / OpenMP / LTO on release.

## Current state (2026-08-28)

Home **+** expands to **Import** (existing `MediaPickerSheet`) or **Record**
(`ui/capture/`: setup → Camera-app test shot → contrast ROI → SSSIG gate →
hardware AF lock → timed stills → wizard via `PICKED_REF_URI` +
`PICKED_DEF_URIS`). Stills only — the video path is gone. Frames are lossless
grayscale PNG written straight from the locked session's `YUV_420_888` luma
plane (`GrayPngEncoder`), never JPEG; the reference frame stays whatever the
vendor Camera app wrote for the test shot, resized to match by
`CaptureFrameSizeMatcher`.

The offered frame rates are a short list, not a free slider: `CaptureFrameCost`
takes the larger of the Camera2 sensor read-out floor
(`CameraCapabilities.sensorFloorMs`) and a real on-device PNG-encode timing
(`CaptureCalibration`, re-measured once after the test shot), and
`CapturePlanOptions` builds the chips from it with `ASSURANCE_MARGIN` on top so
every rate shown is one the run will actually deliver. `StillSequenceRunner`
schedules each frame from t0 rather than from its predecessor, so a slow frame
cannot walk the run off the end of the test window, and `CaptureWorkspace`
clears the previous run's frames so a shorter run cannot inherit the tail of a
longer one.

**Precision work on this branch.** A phone shooting a *static* specimen on a
tripod used to report Exx spanning 48 me — the vendor camera app's own
processing, not the engine, which is bit-exact against its oracles. Two device
runs (Samsung SM-G996U1, Pixel 6) now measure 8.7 me and 3.5 me on the same
kind of scene, with convergence up from 72.7% to 77.3% / 94.8%. What changed:

- `CaptureIspLock` freezes every ISP key the device *lists* — OIS, EIS, noise
  reduction, edge, tonemap, shading, aberration, scene/effect, zoom and AWB —
  and nothing it does not, so a LEGACY HAL gets the subset it honours rather
  than a rejected request that takes the session down. Every key is read back
  out of the `TotalCaptureResult`; what the HAL ignored is named once, effect
  first, with a FAQ link.
- `ExposurePlan` rounds the converged exposure **up** to a whole mains
  half-period (10 ms at 50 Hz, 8.333 ms at 60 Hz, 50 ms when the device will
  not say which — 50 ms is a whole number of both) and scales ISO down to
  hold brightness. Flicker stops moving the tone between frames.
- `NoiseFloorGate` takes up to 5 stills at the end of the test shot, on the
  run's own settings, with the specimen mounted and nothing loaded yet. Five
  is derived, not round: a monotone run of *k* exchangeable values has
  probability `2/k!`, so the drift test is a coin flip at 3 and usable at 5.
  The verdict **warns and never blocks** — `Record anyway` is the primary
  action and the floor is stamped on the session, the PDF cover and every CSV
  row, because an override that leaves no trace is how a bad number becomes a
  published number. A clean pass is also a dialog: **Continue** (not Record
  anyway), with ⓘ for the FAQ — not **Why?**, because the number is a fact.
- **`strain_window` is a diameter in pixels**, not a multiple of the step
  (`VsgStudy.vsgFor`). The gate quoted floors 3-5x better than the settings
  could deliver until the device data caught it. `MAX_STRAIN_WINDOW` (101 px)
  is now the binding limit on how small a floor can honestly be reported.
- The subset recommendation solves against `D(eta)` measured on *this* phone
  under *this* light instead of the 2008 paper's lab camera — but only for a
  run this app captured, and `SubsetRecommender.thresholdFor` clamps so a
  measurement can only ever **raise** the threshold. The Pixel reported
  `D = 0.35` against the Samsung's 34 because a vendor denoiser was running
  underneath the frozen pipeline; believing it would have recommended a subset
  smaller than the paper's own default. `NoiseFloorPixels.noiseCorrelationOf`
  catches that case directly — sensor noise is white between neighbours, a
  denoiser is not — and warns.
- `RigidBodyFit` reports how much of each frame's displacement was the whole
  scene moving (both phones walked 1-2 px over 60 s, monotone, thermal). It is
  **reported and never subtracted**: uniform translation already cancels in
  strain, and a fit taken over the whole ROI would remove real deformation
  along with it.
- `CaptureGallerySave` puts a second copy of the as-captured frames in
  `Pictures/semper/<date>-<time>` so the raw measurement is reachable without this
  app. It never blocks the run and skips with one line when there is no room.

Shipped on this branch from that precision work: k-averaging on the reference
only ([AveragingPlan]; no precision-mode toggle), a catalogue that can offer
frames above 2048 px when RAM allows ([sustainableCeiling]), and picking the
longest rear lens by physical camera id ([pickBackCameraId]). Tap-to-focus /
user-confirmed focus before the test shot was never built and is not open work
here. `RawRgba` closed the DNG-in-`RoiDrawActivity` gap:
one shared helper detects a `w*h*4` blob and samples straight into a
preview-sized bitmap, so the full-resolution allocation never happens.

Import measures a frame the way the engine will see it: `ExifOrientedSize`
applies the EXIF orientation tag to `BitmapFactory`'s bounds, because OpenCV's
`imdecode` rotates and `BitmapFactory` does not. Without it one portrait photo
picked as both reference and deformed frame reported a size mismatch against
itself (4080×3072 vs 3072×4080).

A sweep now runs its whole plan. `ConvergenceGate` is the batch path only:
a batch's consecutive solves are successive frames, so decorrelation means
every later frame is worse, but a sweep's are parameter combinations on one
frame pair, ordered smallest subset first — exactly the ones most likely to
under-converge. The gate was killing sweeps in their opening combinations.

The wizard's inline format warning names whichever formats in the set are not
lossless (`LossyFormatCheck`), reference included, instead of only saying
"JPEG".

**Security pass on this branch.** `_emails_conflict` fails closed, so a token
with no email cannot adopt a device-bound account, and adoption additionally
requires `email_verified`. First-sign-in profile creation uses `create()`
rather than `set()`, so a launch race cannot reset an approved profile to
PENDING. The device signature covers the query string when a request has one.
`AuthActivity` checks arriving auth links against `AUTH_HOST` before handing an
`oobCode` to Firebase — the activity is exported, so an explicit intent
bypasses the App Link filter. The ROI mask read and the RAW reference copy in
`StaticAnalysisActivity` moved off the main thread.

The Demo/Professional plan and license-key work that was mixed into this
working tree belongs to **`feat/license-demo-pro`** and was moved there: no
`plan`, entitlement flags, or license fields are part of the user account
definition on this branch.

`origin/main` includes PRs #85–#96 (FAQ error map). Open follow-up: wizard
step/overlap + step-2/3 reorder ([#97](https://github.com/semperdic/semperdic-app/pull/97)).
Refresh with `gh pr list --state open` — anything named here will rot.

New analysis picks media in-sheet (Images gallery; **Files** dismisses the sheet
and opens SAF). The reference picker opens full height and dims the grid for
1 s behind a large centred hint ("Select the reference image"); deformed
multi-select stays immediate. Wizard warnings (JPEG, low speckle, frame-size
mismatch, ROI too small, empty/too-big sweep plan) and remaining actionable
errors (engine failure dialog **Why?** plus a lasting ⓘ on the status line,
import / video, viewer batch/OOM/scale, lattice hollow nodes) link to FAQ
anchors on the public site behind a leave-the-app confirm
([docs/app/FAQ_LINKS.md](docs/app/FAQ_LINKS.md)). Frame-size copy names the
mismatched files. `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` / `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` are requested when
the gallery tab needs them. Summary GIFs bake `viewer_canvas` (night `#101518`)
into the cache filename. Launcher adaptive background is day `#F4F9FC` / night
`#101518`; night inverts the S on splash (`windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`).

Viewer chrome is inset-aware glass: heatmap rest-fit contains the ROI or
accepted points between the top bar and the scrub bar (colour scale overlays
the right edge), field switcher as a top-left glass pill with the live field
checked in its popup, auto-hiding on a timer, restored by a centre double-tap
when faded. A short tap anywhere on the figure probes. Settings' Analyses rows
carry three actions — **Download** (SAF destination first, then a worker),
**Restore** (only when local frames are gone) and **Delete**. The sweep
lattice's plot toggle is an **All / Node** pill defaulting to **All**; the scrub
readout shows x and y.

Docs for all of the above: [docs/app/WORKFLOWS.md](docs/app/WORKFLOWS.md).

A single-setting run that solves zero points shows the same VSG-failure
wording as a sweep lattice node, not the generic "No data produced" dialog.

**Next architecture (grill before coding):** `DicKeys` extras bag packed in
`SessionOpenHelper.intentFor` and `AnalysisNavHelper.openResults` (~25 extras).
A deep `ViewerSession` module would be the one pack/unpack. Session **commit**
still sits on `AnalysisViewModel`'s public field bag after the JNI loop leaves.

**PRs target `main`.** Do not force-push `main`.
