## Product

Semper is an Android app that measures **how a surface deforms** from photographs.
A specimen is painted with random speckle; one **reference** image and one or more
**deformed** frames go through an on-device C++ engine. Output is a full-field
**displacement** (U, V, ~1/100 px) and **strain** (Exx, Eyy, Exy) as interactive
heatmaps, PDF, CSV, and PNG.

Analysis is **offline**. Cloud (Firebase Auth → Cloud Run → Firestore → Drive) is
optional identity, metadata, and blob sync. Bytes never transit Cloud Run; the
phone PUTs to a Drive resumable URI. No JSON service-account keys.

## Domain terms

Use these words. Do not invent synonyms.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| subset | Odd-width pixel window tracked around its center (default ~41 px) |
| step | Grid spacing between tracked points, px |
| ZNSSD | Match score; 0 = perfect, ≤ 0.15 accepted, < 0 failed-point sentinel |
| ICGN | Iterative Gauss-Newton sub-pixel solver |
| VSG | Strain window: least-squares plane fit, odd width |
| `.dat` | Binary field: 8 floats/point (`x y u v exx eyy exy znssd`), 32 bytes |
| session | One saved analysis on disk (and optionally in the cloud) |

Engine pipeline (detail in `native/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`): AKAZE seeds → Delaunay
mesh → RGDIC flood-fill → ICGN → VSG strain → `.dat`.

## Layout

```
app/          Android UI + JNI adapter (`app/src/main/cpp/`)
native/       Pinned submodule: semperdic/semper-dic-engine (solver, tests, docs)
backend/      FastAPI on Cloud Run — routers in backend/app/routers/
firebase-hosting/  Auth continue URLs, asset links, generated legal pages
docs/         Human docs. This file is the agent map.
```

The engine is **not** in this repo. Bump it by changing the `native` gitlink.
Engine host / sanitizer / DICe suites run in the engine repo. This CI only proves
the pin still **links** (emulator x86_64, release arm64).

## Runtime

```
Splash → Auth / Pending / Home
Home → StaticAnalysisActivity (wizard) → ResultViewerActivity
     → open session → ResultViewerActivity | VsgLatticeActivity
```

Access routing is `AccessRouter` + `AccessStatus`. Intent extras are `DicKeys`.
Session dirs: `SessionStore` + `SessionPaths` (`raw_deformed/`, `frame_%04d.dat`).

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `ui/analysis/` | Wizard, ROI, import, VSG sweep, batch run |
| `ui/viewer/` | Heatmaps, probe, `ShareCenter` |
| `ui/settings/` | `SettingsActivity` + `Settings*Section` |
| `ui/home/` | Session list |
| `ui/common/` | Insets, `MediaPickerSheet`, `CrispToast`, `TransferBannerController` |
| `data/` | Auth, session store, upload/restore/download workers, storage budget |
| `analytics/` | `SemperAnalytics` — consent-gated events, same flag as Crashlytics |
| `report/` | PDF / CSV / `VisualizationEngine` |
| `backend/app/main.py` | App, middleware, lifespan |
| `backend/app/routers/` | `/v1/*` by prefix: health, account, devices, sessions, files, provision_tasks, admin |
| `backend/app/session_provision.py` | `provision_session` / `purge_session` |

Kotlin helpers are plain `object` / small classes (`*Helper`, `*Runner`, `*Bundler`).
No Hilt/Dagger. Keep `lifecycleScope` and Activity Result launchers on the Activity.

Wizard later steps inflate through **ViewStubs**. `goToStep` stays on
`StaticAnalysisActivity`. Slot chrome / coach marks: `AnalysisWizardSlots` /
`AnalysisWizardCoach`.

Full-field batch: `DicBatchRunner` + `DicFieldIo` shared with VSG. JNI
`computeFullFieldDirect` stays **inside that one loop**.

New analysis starts in `MediaPickerSheet` — one sheet for the Home FAB and both
wizard dropzones (Images grid in-sheet, Files → SAF). Long transfers show a
non-modal `TransferBannerController` strip in Settings and the viewer; uploads,
restores, `DicBundleDownloadWorker` downloads and backup deletes are WorkManager.

## Invariants

- **Bit-exact fields.** Do not change `.dat` packing, ZNSSD threshold, or DatCodec
  oracles unless the engine contract major-bumps. GIF bytes are pinned 0-delta.
- **JNI buffer is bounded.** Allocate to the ROI grid; a point count over capacity
  is an engine failure, never a read past the buffer.
- **Do not split** VisualizationEngine loops, GifEncoder LZW, ReportBuilder fusion,
  `DicResult.decodeDatFile`, `DicUploadWorker.doWork`, `prefetchAround` /
  `ScrubFrameCache`, `PointSpatialIndex.build`.
- **Scrub cache** is byte-bounded and filled by **one** serialized worker.
- **Whole-batch** summary / spatial index start on demand, never on viewer open.
- **Batch progress** is a buffered `SharedFlow` (`DROP_OLDEST`), not a `StateFlow`.
- **Cancel sweep** abandons the sweep (check between combinations).
- **Drive unknown ≠ deleted.** Drop local metadata only when the backend confirms
  a blob is missing.
- **Storage reclaim** frees local frames of **backed-up** sessions only.
- **Analytics and crash reporting share one consent flag** (`DicSettings.diagnosticsEnabled`).
  Events stay PII-free — buckets and enums only, never images, results, session ids
  or specimen names.
- **Release** builds require HTTPS `INDIC_API_BASE_URL`. Debug emulator boots
  local-only unless `INDIC_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false`.
- **Legal pages** are generated: edit `docs/legal/`, run `scripts/render_legal_pages.py`,
  never hand-edit `firebase-hosting/public/{privacy,terms}/`.
- **Image installs `requirements.lock`** with `--require-hashes`. Bump txt and
  regenerate the lock on **Python 3.12**. CI checks versions, not just names.

## Quality gates

Empty `app/lint-baseline.xml` and `app/detekt-baseline.xml`. Prefer a targeted
`@file:Suppress` or an extract over stuffing a baseline.

Open lint warnings (leave them): `OldTargetApi` (`compileSdk` 37 / `targetSdk` 36),
`TooManyViews` on `activity_settings.xml`. Do not bump `targetSdk` or turn on
`warningsAsErrors` in a drive-by.

Kover `minBound` floor is 15. Macrobenchmark CI is emulator **smoke**
(`suppressErrors=EMULATOR,LOW-BATTERY,UNLOCKED`), API 34, no numeric thresholds.

Engine perf floor: [docs/engine/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md](docs/engine/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md)
(≥ 4557 solves/s host). Preserve `-O3 -ffast-math` / OpenMP / LTO on release.

## Current state (2026-08-20)

`origin/main` is `8b40245` (PR #92). Push-to-main CI after that merge failed:
hashed lock compiled on Python 3.13/Windows (missing `uvloop`), and debug
emulator ran `HotPathMicroBenchmark`. Refresh with `gh pr list --state open`.

**Merged since 2026-08-08:** lint extracts #59–#64 and #66; compile/quality #68;
wizard slots/coach #69; `DicBatchRunner` + `DicFieldIo` #70; hashed lock /
Gradle 9.7 / docs #71; faster Release CI #74; API-34 emulators #75; brand/UX
polish #77; device-bound accounts + share logos #78; viewer chrome + media
picker #79; share caption / PDF thread #80; viewer Tufte restyle #81; FAB Files

launcher icon contrast #85; viewer field FAB + vertical colour rail #86;
media-picker grid seam #87; wizard Paste params row #88; wizard FAQ chips #91;
VSG zero-point wording #92.

New analysis picks media in-sheet (Images gallery; **Files** dismisses the sheet
and opens SAF). Wizard warnings (JPEG, low speckle, frame-size mismatch, ROI
too small, empty/too-big sweep plan) link to FAQ anchors on the public site
behind a leave-the-app confirm. `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` / `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` are
requested when the gallery tab needs them. Summary GIFs bake `viewer_canvas`
(night `#101518`) into the cache filename. Launcher adaptive background is
day `#F4F9FC` / night `#101518`; night inverts the S on splash
(`windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`).

Viewer chrome is inset-aware glass: heatmap fit between the top bar and the
scrub bar, field switcher as a top-left glass pill, colour scale as a right
rail, auto-hiding, toggled by a centre tap or a vertical swipe. Settings'
Analyses rows carry three actions — **Download** (SAF destination first, then a
worker), **Restore** (only when local frames are gone) and **Delete**. The sweep
lattice's plot toggle is an **All / Node** pill defaulting to **All**.

Docs for all of the above: [docs/app/WORKFLOWS.md](docs/app/WORKFLOWS.md).

A single-setting run that solves zero points shows the same VSG-failure
wording as a sweep lattice node, not the generic "No data produced" dialog.

**Next architecture (grill before coding):** `DicKeys` extras bag packed in
`SessionOpenHelper.intentFor` and `AnalysisNavHelper.openResults` (~25 extras).
A deep `ViewerSession` module would be the one pack/unpack. Session **commit**
still sits on `AnalysisViewModel`'s public field bag after the JNI loop leaves.

**PRs target `main`.** Do not force-push `main`.
