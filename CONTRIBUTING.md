# Contributing to Semper

Thanks for helping. This repo is a single Android app (`:app`) with an optional
FastAPI backend. The correlation engine is C++ and runs on-device, but it lives
in **its own repository** and is linked here as a pinned submodule — most UI work
is Kotlin and needs no native toolchain at all.

**This file is the source of truth for build, test and quality-gate commands.**
The README links here rather than repeating them.

## Who should read what

| You are… | Start here |
|---|---|
| **New developer** | [README](README.md) → [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) → clone with submodules (below) → [docs/app/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/app/ARCHITECTURE.md). Offline analysis works with no backend. |
| **Contributor** | This file (build/test/PR) + [docs/ops/CI.md](docs/ops/CI.md) for why a check is red. Open PRs against **`main`**. |
| **Maintainer** | [docs/ops/ENVIRONMENTS.md](docs/ops/ENVIRONMENTS.md), [CI.md](docs/ops/CI.md), [RELEASING.md](docs/ops/RELEASING.md), [PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](docs/ops/PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md). |

## Clone and native deps

The `--recursive` matters: `engine/` is a submodule
([`sempermechanics/semper-dic-engine`](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semper-dic-engine)),
and it has submodules of its own for Eigen and OpenCV. A non-recursive clone
gives you an empty `engine/` and a confusing CMake failure on first build.

A checkout from before the folder was renamed from `native/` (ADR-019) needs, after
the pull: `git submodule sync && git submodule update --init --recursive`, then
delete `app/.cxx` (its CMake cache holds the old path).

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd material_testing
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Already cloned without it? `git submodule update --init --recursive` fixes it
in place.

OpenCV's full tree is large. After the first submodule init, apply a sparse
checkout so unused `doc/`, `samples/`, `data/`, and `apps/` trees are dropped
(~100+ MB). The script lives in the engine submodule and is run from there:

```bash
cd native
./scripts/sparse-opencv.sh          # Git Bash / macOS / Linux
.\scripts\sparse-opencv.ps1         # Windows PowerShell
cd ..
```

It is safe to re-run. Eigen stays a normal submodule (headers only, small).

### Bumping the engine

Changing the pinned engine commit is a normal PR in this repo:

```bash
cd native && git fetch && git checkout <commit-or-tag> && cd ..
git add native && git commit -m "Bump engine to <tag>"
```

That gitlink change is what triggers CI tiers 3 and 5 **on push to `main`** (or
on a PR labeled `e2e` / `release` / `full-ci`). The engine's own tests ran in its
repository before that commit existed; this repo only proves the pinned version
still links and behaves. If the bump changes numeric results, declare it against
the tiers in
[docs/engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md](docs/engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md).
material_testing must re-run its real-data checks after it syncs a bump
([docs/ops/FORK_SYNC.md](docs/ops/FORK_SYNC.md)).

### Local disk hygiene

Native OpenCV builds cache under `app/.cxx/` (~GB). Safe to delete when you
need space; the next native build recreates it:

```bash
rm -rf app/.cxx app/build
# Windows: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force app\.cxx, app\build
```

## First reads

1. [README](README.md) — what the product is and how to build
2. [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) — DIC primer, glossary, doc index
3. [docs/app/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/app/ARCHITECTURE.md) — Activity flow and
   Kotlin package map (start here for Android UI changes)

## Build and test

```bash
# Full local push gate (mirrors CI tiers 1 + 5)
./gradlew ciReleaseGate

# Individual steps
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest spotlessCheck :app:detekt :app:lintDebug

# Per-chunk tests — see docs/app/TESTING.md for what each chunk owns
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.sempermechanics.semper.auth.*"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.sempermechanics.semper.session.*"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.sempermechanics.semper.analysis.*"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.sempermechanics.semper.results.*"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.sempermechanics.semper.cloud.*"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.sempermechanics.semper.settings.*"
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.sempermechanics.semper.viewer.*"

# Emulator smoke (needs an x86_64 emulator running)
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PabiFilters=x86_64 "-Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.notPackage=com.sempermechanics.semper.benchmark"

# Performance benchmarks — not part of the push gate; they need a device and are
# label-gated in CI. See docs/app/TESTING.md#performance-benchmarks before running.

# Backend
cd backend && pip install -r requirements-test.txt && pytest tests/ -v

# Engine tests — these build the submodule; they run in the engine repo's CI,
# not this one. See docs/engine/TESTING.md.
cmake -S engine/tests -B build/engine-tests -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/engine-tests -j
./build/engine-tests/dic_tests
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.

### Three gates that run on every PR

None is path-filtered, so a documentation-only change is still subject to all
of them, and each blocks `ci-ok`:

```bash
python scripts/render_legal_pages.py --check   # legal pages match docs/legal/
python scripts/check_console.py                # console wiring, CSP, gateway paths
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml        # secrets (full history; human PRs)
```

`check_console.py` is the consoles' only gate — they have no compiler, so a
renamed element id or an undeclared `/v1` path fails nowhere else. See
[firebase-hosting/public/console/README.md](firebase-hosting/public/console/README.md).

Dependabot PRs use a CLI scan of **only the PR commit range** (no org
`GITLEAKS_LICENSE` on Dependabot). Details: [docs/ops/CI.md](docs/ops/CI.md).

**Never hand-edit `firebase-hosting/public/privacy/` or `.../terms/`.** They are
generated from `docs/legal/*.md` by `scripts/render_legal_pages.py`, and the app
links them as its real user-facing policy. Edit the markdown, re-run the script
without `--check`, and commit both. See
[firebase-hosting/README.md](firebase-hosting/README.md).

Cloud features need `SEMPER_API_BASE_URL` in `local.properties` and Firebase
setup — see [docs/backend/AUTH_SETUP.md](docs/backend/AUTH_SETUP.md). Local
analysis works fine without it. Note that a **release** build is stricter: it
fails outright if that URL is missing or not HTTPS, so cloud sync cannot ship
silently disabled.

## CI

CI is defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
See [docs/ops/CI.md](docs/ops/CI.md) for the tier map and required checks.
The single required status check is `CI OK` (`ci-ok`).

- PRs into **`main`**: gates + path-filtered Tier 1 / Tier 4. Add label `e2e`,
  `release`, or `full-ci` for Tier 3 / Tier 5 on the PR.
- Push to **`main`**: full matrix.
- Dependabot: cheap path (actions = gates only; pip = Tier 4; gradle = Tier 1).

Warm full-matrix wall clock is ~45–60 min (emulator and signed release run in
parallel). Kotlin/docs-only PRs run ~10–15 min via path filters.

Prefer extracting a part (a `*Controller`, `*Section` or `*Runner`, named by the
rules below) next to existing ones over growing a god Activity. Do not
introduce a DI framework for tiny helpers — there is no
Hilt/Dagger in this app (removed as unused, zero `@Inject` sites); if a screen
grows real injectable dependencies, propose the framework in its own PR rather
than sneaking it into an unrelated one.

## Code style

Formatting is ktlint (Spotless) and detekt; see "Three gates" above. Packages
and file size: [ADR-015](docs/adr/ADR-015-package-layout.md). Names follow the
Kotlin coding conventions and Android resource naming, as this codebase applies
them:

**Files and types**

1. A file holding one main type is named after it. A file of functions, or of
   several related types, gets a noun phrase for its content (`RoiCodecs`,
   `ToggleGroups`, `*Conversions`); never `Ext`, `Util` or `Helper`.
2. Class names spell words out (`Reference`, `Deformed`, `Image`). Members may
   use the domain abbreviations (`ref`, `def`, `roi`, `vsg`, `img`, `px`).
   Acronyms are one capital (`Dic`, `Roi`, `Vsg`, `Dat`, `Ui`).
3. Codecs end in `Encoder` / `Decoder`; every `Throwable` subclass ends in
   `Exception`.

**Role suffixes, one meaning each**

4. `*Controller`: built with a host Activity or binding, it owns a screen
   region's views and behaviour. A part may instead be named for the region it
   is: `*Section`, `*Card`, `*Sheet`, `*Chrome`, `*Slots`, `*Banner`.
5. `*Helper`: a stateless `object` of functions only, never a class with state.
6. `*Store` owns persisted state; `*Loader` loads data into memory for display;
   `*Runner` executes a planned computation; `*Run` is one execution's state or a
   process-scoped operation ([ADR-016](docs/adr/ADR-016-work-that-outlives-the-activity.md));
   `*Gate` decides whether something may proceed; `*Builder` assembles one artifact.
7. A closed set of "how it ended" values (sealed type or enum) is an `*Outcome`
   ([ADR-018](docs/adr/ADR-018-error-convention.md)). No type is named bare
   `Result`: it hides `kotlin.Result` and `ListenableWorker.Result`.

**Functions**

8. A function with side effects starts with a verb. A pure function that returns
   a value may be a noun phrase (`sessionDir(id)`).
9. Data access: `fetch*` is a network round trip; `read*` a synchronous local read
   (file, prefs, Intent); `load*` an asynchronous load into memory or the UI, or
   a `*Loader`'s entry point; `get*` a cheap in-memory lookup, or an Intent /
   Bundle extension mirroring Android's names. `CloudApi` keeps REST verbs
   (`get`, `list`, `create`, `complete`, `replace`, `delete`).
10. A Boolean predicate reads as a yes/no question: `is` / `has` / `can` /
    `should` / `was` / `are`, a third-person verb (`fits`, `swapsAxes`), or
    `<feature>Enabled` for a settings switch, paired with `set<Feature>Enabled`.
11. A suspend function never ends in `Async` (that means "returns `Deferred`").
    A suspend twin of a blocking function is `<name>OnIo` (or `<name>OnMain`).
12. Factories: `of(parts)`; `from<Source>()` for a conversion; `create()` for
    fallible construction of a resource-owning object; `new<Thing>()` for a fresh
    instance, id or dir; `build<Thing>()` for multi-step assembly. A wire value is
    `wire` (String) or `wireCode` (Int), with `fromWire` / `fromWireCode` back.
13. Extension functions follow 8–10; on an Android type they mirror its naming
    (`Bundle.putRoi` / `getRoi`).
14. Tests: JVM tests are backtick sentences. Instrumented tests are camelCase
    sentences (minSdk 24's DEX rejects spaces in method names). Benchmarks keep
    their names: scripts and result history compare them by name. Test doubles
    are `Fake<Thing>`; a device-only test class ends in `DeviceTest`.

**Variables and properties**

15. Boolean properties may be adjectives or participles (`enabled`,
    `stoppedEarly`); many are persisted `SessionRecord` fields.
16. No generic abbreviations (`ctx`, `vm`, `msg`, `err`, `iv`, `cb`, `cnt`); a
    screen's ViewModel property is `viewModel`. Math and loop locals (`i`, `w`,
    `h`, `idx`, `tmp`) are fine.
17. Reach a view through `binding.<id>`; an unavoidable alias uses the id's exact
    name. No `m` prefix. A backing property is `_name` beside `name`.
18. Units go in a suffix: `Ms`, `Us`, `Seconds` / `SECONDS`, `Minutes`, `Bytes`,
    `Px`, `Dp`, `Pt`.
19. One constant name per concept (`MS_PER_SECOND`, `PERCENT`).

**Resources**

20. A layout is `<kind>_<owner>`, the kind being how it is inflated: `activity`,
    `dialog` (AlertDialog), `sheet` (BottomSheetDialog), `item`, `popup`,
    `toast`, `view` (an `<include>`, `<merge>` or custom-view layout) or `menu`.
    The wizard's ViewStub pages keep `wizard_step_*`.
21. A drawable is `ic_` (icon) or `bg_` (background); brand art and
    illustrations are exempt.
22. A view id is camelCase. A leaf widget's prefix names its actual widget:
    `tv`, `btn` (any clickable action, a Chip included), `et`, `rb`, `rg` (also a
    `MaterialButtonToggleGroup`), `cb`, `til`, `img`, `rv`, `switch`, `slider`,
    `spinner`, `progress`, `scroll`, `stub`. Containers and custom views get a
    semantic name; cards end in `Card`.
23. A string key is snake_case `<screen>_<purpose>`, ending in `_fmt` when it has
    placeholders. Button verbs are `action_*`, links `url_*`, errors `error_*`. A
    key is never named after its own text.
24. No company name in identifiers or resource names.

**Never renamed:** persisted values keep their exact strings (prefs files and
keys, intent extras, Bundle / SavedState keys, WorkManager names, tags and Data
keys, `index.json` / metadata fields, analytics events, the Keystore alias); a
Kotlin rename may keep the value. The six Workers, `SemperNativeLib`,
`ProgressCallback` and the Activities keep their names
([ADR-015](docs/adr/ADR-015-package-layout.md)). A rename of a shared API gets a
row in [FORK_SYNC](docs/ops/FORK_SYNC.md).

## Pull requests

- Target **`main`**. Keep PRs focused (one concern: dead-code cleanup, one helper
  extract, one feature).
- Follow the naming rules in [Code style](#code-style) and the package layout
  ([ADR-015](docs/adr/ADR-015-package-layout.md)).
- Run the relevant tests above before asking for review.
- Link issues when applicable; `good first issue` tags are scoped for newcomers.
- If you change auth, quotas, deploy env vars, or CI modes, update the matching
  doc under `docs/` in the same PR.
- Do not force-push `main`. Prefer revert of a bad merge over history rewrite.
- A fix to code material_testing shares lands here first, even when it was found
  there; port its commit with `git cherry-pick -x` ([docs/ops/FORK_SYNC.md](docs/ops/FORK_SYNC.md)).
