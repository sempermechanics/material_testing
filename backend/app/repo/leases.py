    `leasesActive` drifts upward every time an app is killed, uninstalled or
    simply goes offline mid-lease, so the counter alone cannot be trusted to
    say whether the pool is full. This reconciles it before a claim reads it.

    A single-field inequality on one subcollection, so no composite index is
    needed. Positional `.where(field, op, value)` deliberately — the fake store
    used by the unit tests implements only that form, not `FieldFilter`.

    Deliberately outside the claim transaction: a transaction may not run a
    query, and sweeping first is safe because releasing a genuinely expired
    lease is correct regardless of who wins the claim that follows.

    Being outside a transaction makes the query's answer a list of
    candidates, not a fact. Two checkouts arriving together both see the same
    expired seats; when this was one batch that cleared them and subtracted
    the count, both batches committed, each seat came off `leasesActive`
    twice, and the pool admitted more than `maxSeats`. Each seat is now
    reclaimed in its own transaction that re-reads it, so only the first
    sweeper to reach a seat counts it.
