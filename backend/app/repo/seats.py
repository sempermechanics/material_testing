    """Finish a device change on the holder's account. `{app: released device id}`.

    `locks` is the lock each cleared app held, keyed by app (ADR-010); every
    step below is taken per app, against that app's own fields, and the
    answer names every app in `locks`, with "" where nothing was released.

    Clearing the lock is only one of the three bindings a device change moves:

    - **Mode.** Until 2026-09-28 a device change was usually preceded by the
      holder trying the new device, and `revalidate_device_lock` stored that
      mismatch as `mode: demo` on the user document. It now serves Demo to the
      mismatching device's requests only, but accounts demoted before then
      still carry it, and `revalidate_device_lock` returns early for an
      account that reads as demo, so it would never reach the bind branch and
      the holder would sit on Demo holding a live licence. The mode is
      re-stamped here. Nothing is resurrected: `effective_mode` still
      re-applies expiry, grace and the floating-lease check, so a licence that
      has run out stays demo either way.
    - **Registered device.** `POST /v1/devices/register` refuses any device but
      `users/{uid}.activeDeviceId` with `device_conflict`, and nothing else
      empties that field short of suspending the account. It is dropped here
      and the old device retired (`_retire_device`), so the new phone can
      register. Only when it is the phone the cleared `lock` named, or the
      lock named none: a lock on some other device (bound before
      `revalidate_device_lock` bound only the registered phone) leaves the
      account split, and the registered phone is the one still working. It
      is kept and binds the empty lock on its next request; a holder who did
      want a new phone gets it from a second clear, which then releases it.
    - **Release hold.** The released id is stamped (`releasedDeviceId`,
      `releasedAt`) so registration can hold it off for
      `DEVICE_RELEASE_HOLD_HOURS`: the old phone's upload worker re-registers as
      soon as it reads `device_not_active`, and would otherwise take the account
      straight back (`repo.devices.released_device_held`).

    One read of the user and one batch, so the mode and the release land
    together. Nothing is written where `_live_holder` says no: a revoked
    licence, a seat that is revoked or on hold, an account that has moved to a
    different licence.

    Deliberately outside the caller's transaction: reading `users/{uid}` and
    then writing it inside one takes a lock on that document, which is what
    starved out concurrent claims before `_drop_superseded_demo` moved the
    same guarded read out of `claim_seat`.

    """Unbind a licence or a seat from the device it is on. Returns the audit
    detail, or raises `Refusal`.

    One primitive with three callers — Semper staff, institution IT, and the
    holder — because there is one operation. Since Gap A, clearing the lock is
    the *whole* device change: an empty lock reads as `_Lock.UNBOUND`, and
    `revalidate_device_lock` binds it to whatever signs in next, first writer
    wins. Nothing is re-activated and nothing is typed.

    **Clearing is not revoking.** Entitlement, seat, lease and data are all
    untouched; the lock goes empty and the holder's device binding is released,
    so the new phone can register. A holder demoted in place by the mismatch
    they hit on the new device gets their mode back. Both are
    `_settle_holder`; without it, clearing would be half a device change.

    `uid` selects the seat on an institution licence. An individual licence
    holds its lock on the licence document itself, so `uid` is ignored there.

    **Which apps.** Each app has its own lock (ADR-010). A staff or IT clear
    releases every app, because the holder's phone changed and both apps are
    on it. The holder's own clear releases `app` alone, the app that asked,
    and its cooldown is that app's: moving Semper to a new phone does not make
    Material Testing wait a month to follow.

    The cooldown applies to `ACTOR_SELF` alone. A second factor proves *who*
    is asking, not *how often*, so one person could otherwise re-bind daily
    and pass a single licence round a lab. It is counted against
    `deviceChangedAt`, which only this path writes: a staff or IT clear
    neither reads nor writes that stamp, so a support request always works
    however recently the holder changed device themselves. Each app has its
    own stamp (`apps.field("deviceChangedAt", app)`).

    The answer is the audit detail, including the device
    that was given up — the other half of the record `revalidate_device_lock`
    writes when the replacement binds. `previousDeviceId` is the lock's device
    and `releasedDeviceId` the registered one the account was signed out of;
    a registered phone the lock did not name is kept (`_settle_holder`), and either can be empty (a lock that never bound, an
    account with nothing registered, or a holder `_settle_holder` skips). A
    `device_change_too_soon` refusal carries the instant the next change is
    allowed, so it can say when.
    Both device ids come once per app (`apps.spread`): `previousDeviceId` and
    `releasedDeviceId` are Semper's, `previousDeviceIdMaterialTesting` and so
    on the other app's, "" for an app the clear did not touch.
