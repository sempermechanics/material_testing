"""Deactivating a phone, scoped by who asks (ADR-033).

Who may deactivate follows the role, and each scope is checked here, not only
by which route a call came in on:

- the holder (`ACTOR_SELF`): their own phones, on the licence they hold;
- institution IT (`ACTOR_IT`): phones of members on the licence's
  `domainLock`, on an institution licence that names them in `adminEmails`;
- staff (`ACTOR_STAFF`): any phone.

Apart from `repo.activations` because an IT or staff deactivation also signs
the phone out (`repo.devices`), which loads after the licence check.
