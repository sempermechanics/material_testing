    Transactional rather than a bare update: two devices signing in at once
    both read an empty lock, and with a plain write the later one would win,
    so the licence would silently follow whichever request Firestore happened
    to order second. Re-reading inside the transaction makes the first binding
    stick and turns the second device into a mismatch on its next request,
    which is the answer a device lock exists to give.

    Losing the race is not the same as someone winning it. Firestore aborts
    contended transactions, and a burst of them can all run out of retries
    with nothing committed — the emulator does this to eight concurrent binds.
    So a starved round re-reads the lock: held means another caller won and
    this one answers False; still empty means nobody won, and the bind runs
    again. Only after `_BIND_ROUNDS` does it give up, raising
    `DeviceLockContended` rather than returning False, because False would
    tell `_activate_individual` this device is a mismatch for a licence no

    rather than waiting for the next explicit revoke/activate to notice. No-op
    (and no write) for Demo accounts, accounts with no license on file, or a
    call with no device id to check.

    A device that does not match the lock gets Demo for *its own requests*,
    and nothing is written. The mismatch says this device is not the
    licensed one, not that the licence ended, and the device holding the lock
    must stay licensed. Storing it let any other device demote the account for
    good: a phone refused at `POST /v1/devices/register` still sends its
    profile and config calls, and so does a second app on the same phone,
    whose ANDROID_ID (and so device id) differs because it is signed with
    another key (material_testing ADR-009, 2026-09-28). `effective_mode` then
    read Demo everywhere, and this function's early return for Demo meant the
    licensed phone never undid it; only a device-lock clear did.

    Also the moment an unbound licence acquires its device. A licence minted
    against an email, or a seat added to a roster, carries no lock until
    someone actually signs in — so the first authed request that presents a
    device id binds it here, if that device may take it (`_may_bind`). That
    is what makes "we mint against your address and you sign in" tie a
    licence to a device with no key and no activation step; see
    _device_lock_state.

    `app` is the app the request came from (`X-App-Id`). Each app has its own
    lock, so Semper and Material Testing on one phone are each checked against
    their own device id, and neither is a mismatch for the other (ADR-010).

    This only ever *removes* entitlement in place — it never deletes or hides
    the account's sessions/files, and re-locking to a *different* device
    happens only after a staff, IT or self-service clear of the existing lock.
