    `ensure_demo_license` is a compare-and-set, so a request that lost the
    race can no longer stamp Demo *over* a real licence. The opposite order is
    what is left: the loser commits its Demo key first, the winning claim then
    moves the account's pointer, and the Demo record survives
    `status: "redeemed"` with nobody holding it — indistinguishable in
    `GET /v1/admin/licenses` from a live key, one more of them for every raced
    sign-in.

    This runs after a claim commits, deliberately not inside it. Reading
    `users/{uid}` in the claim's transaction looked like the tidy answer, and
    it is wrong: a transaction that reads and then writes one document locks
    it, so several requests arriving at one account together — the shape of
    every app launch, and of the invite delivery path — abort each other
    instead of queueing. Measured against the emulator, six concurrent
    sign-ins starved out completely and the account landed on Demo. A plain
    query and a guarded delete take no locks, and the worst a lost race costs
    here is that the record survives to the next claim: the condition being
    closed is litter in the operator listing, never a wrong entitlement.

    The discriminator is the licence document, never the holder's `mode`
    mirror. `_drop_user_to_demo_if_licensed` leaves a revoked holder demoted
    in place and still pointing at the real, revoked licence, so a mirror test
    would delete revocation records — considerably worse than the leak this
    closes. Only `ensure_demo_license` writes `mode: demo` and
    `createdByUid: "system"` together.

    This was a read-then-`WriteBatch` — atomic for its writes, but carrying no

    ten both saw nine free and the count landed at eleven. A batch is not a
    transaction. With a floating pool the count is the actual boundary rather
    than a soft allocation, so the whole claim now reads and writes under one.

    Every read happens before every write, as Firestore requires. The seat
    validation lives inside for the same reason as the count: it is decided
    from data read in the transaction.

    `invite_ref`, when given, is a pending invite being redeemed: it is read
    with the other reads and deleted with the other writes, so the seat and
    the invite settle together. Consuming it in a second write would leave a
    window where IT has revoked the invite but the seat is granted anyway, or
