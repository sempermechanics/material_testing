    `activeDeviceId` names the latest. The checks and the writes are one

    (`device_in_use`), so two accounts registering one phone at once cannot
    both hold it. The same device id re-registering is the reinstall heal: its
    key and stamp are replaced (`healed` in the answer).

    A real account holds up to `MAX_PHONES_PER_APP` phones per app. Past it,
    the phones that registered first make room, retired as superseded in the
    same transaction, but never the phone its licence is locked to
    (`devlock.licensed_devices`, read before the transaction). The answer's
    `rotated` lists them.

    A test account (ADR-027) holds up to its own `maxDevices`. A full QC
    account is refused (`device_conflict`); a full CI account retires its
    oldest phones, since every CI run is a fresh emulator with a new key
    (TD-248). A phone staff released from the test account on its own
    (`staff_released_from`) is refused `device_released` for that account, so
    it cannot take back the place it gave up (TD-249); another account may
    still register it.

    A registration of the released phone itself ends its release hold (the
    router has already refused it while the hold lasts); another phone
    registering leaves the hold in place.

    `step_up_eligible` is whether the registering token proved a second factor
    (ADR-010, device trust). Stamped on every registration, a heal included,
    because a registration replaces the key: only a device registered from a
