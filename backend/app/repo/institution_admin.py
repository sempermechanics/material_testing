    Exactly one of `seat` and `invite` is set on success. An address with no

    IT works from a list of addresses and cannot make people sign up first, so
    refusing them was pushing a scheduling problem onto the wrong person.

    Idempotent for an active seat, and re-adding someone previously revoked
    gives them a fresh slot. A *disabled* seat is refused with
    `license_seat_disabled` — disable is a deliberate hold that IT lifts with
    `enabled=true`, and silently undoing it here would make the two routes
