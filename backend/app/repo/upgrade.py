"""Turning an individual licence into an institution licence.

A lab buys one licence, then the department buys for everyone. The person
who held the individual licence must not lose a day of it, their device, or
their data, and must not end up holding two licences. So the institution
licence is minted carrying the individual one's terms, the holder is seated
on it in the same transaction that moves their account, and only then is the
individual licence revoked — with `supersededBy` naming its replacement, so
the audit trail and the desk can follow the chain.

    has signed in, the address it is locked to — must be on `domain_lock`,
