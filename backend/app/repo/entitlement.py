    Both licence kinds arrive here. An institution invite takes a seat; an
    individual one attaches the licence itself — the two ways a licence is
    delivered without anybody typing a key, and the only two. The invite
    record does not say which; the licence it points at does, which is why
    there is one collection rather than two.

    Returns the updated user when something was claimed, otherwise the user
    unchanged. Called from `ensure_entitlement`, i.e. exactly where a Demo key
    would otherwise be minted — so an invited newcomer lands licensed on their
    first request rather than demo-then-upgraded.

    The guards are `ensure_demo_license`'s, and they bound the cost: this runs
    only for an approved, verified account that holds no licence yet, which is
    a one-request window before the Demo key exists. It is not a per-request
    read. The one exception is an account whose claim already failed for a
    reason that can clear, which tries again at most every `_INVITE_RETRY`
    while it holds Demo.

    Email verification is required and not merely preferred. The invite names
    an address, and the address is the whole claim to the seat; honouring an
    unverified one would let anyone who can type someone else's address take
    the institution seat meant for them.
