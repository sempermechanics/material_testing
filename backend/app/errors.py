"""Stable error codes returned as FastAPI's `{"detail": "<code>"}`.

These strings are a wire contract, not messages: the Android client branches on
them (`app/src/main/java/com/indicvision/semper/data/net/ApiErrors.kt`) to tell a
device conflict from a quota rejection inside the same status code. Naming them
here means a rename is one edit that `tests/test_error_codes.py` then holds
against the client's copy, instead of a literal typed in a router that silently
stops matching.

Codes are lowercase snake_case and carry no user data — they are safe to log and
safe to show. Anything a caller needs beyond the code (counts, sizes) goes after
a colon, as `session_quota_exceeded` does.

Not exhaustive in one respect: `validation.py` generates a `missing_<field>` /
`invalid_<field>` family per rejected identifier, so those codes are built at
runtime rather than named here.
