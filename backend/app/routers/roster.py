"""An institution licence's roster: list, add, hold, unbind, remove.

One set of routes, mounted for two tiers. Institution IT reach them at
`/v1/institutions/licenses/{license_id}/…`, scoped to the licences that name
them (`routers/institutions.py`). Semper staff reach the same operations at
`/v1/admin/licenses/{license_id}/…` for any institution licence
(`routers/admin.py`), because support requests reach Semper before they reach
the customer's own IT often enough that staff need an answer. Only the tier
differs:
- who may call, and with which step-up;
- which rate-limit bucket they spend;
- who the device-change actor is (only the holder's own change has a cooldown);
- the prefix on the audit actions.
