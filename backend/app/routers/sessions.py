    to someone sitting at a desk who has lost the phone. This route is the

    Every artifact goes in at `<role>/<name>`, the layout the app writes and

    `extras/Extras.zip`); older ones store a file per artifact. Both are the
    same loop — the archive is of whatever was stored, with no special case.

    Stored, not deflated: the contents are already-compressed PNG and zip
    data, so compressing again would spend CPU per byte to save nothing, and
    the stream would run at the speed of the compressor rather than of Drive.

    **Every refusal happens before the first byte.** Once a response body has
