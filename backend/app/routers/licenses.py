    Deliberately unaudited. A client calls this every half hour per active

    write on a per-request path costs. The roster changes that matter —
    joining and leaving the license — are audited where they happen.

    """"Use Semper on a different device" — the holder's own device change.

    Until now only institution IT could unbind a device, which left an
    individual customer, and any member whose IT is slow, writing to support
    for something they can prove they are entitled to do. Since Gap A,
    clearing the lock is the whole operation: the licence or seat goes
    unbound, and the next device to sign in binds it, first writer wins.

    **Clearing is not revoking.** The entitlement, the seat, the lease and
    every analysis stay exactly as they are; only the lock goes empty. Nothing
    has to be typed on the new device.

    Step-up rather than plain USER: this is worth more than a bearer token,
    and it is reachable from a browser. But a second factor proves *who* is
    asking, not *how often*, so it is also the one caller subject to
    SELF_DEVICE_CHANGE_COOLDOWN_DAYS — one person could otherwise re-bind
    daily and pass a single licence round a lab. Staff and IT are not, so a
    support request always works.

    The order on the new device matters and the app should follow it: sign in
    (USER-tier, so `POST /v1/devices/register` works before any licence
    binds), let the first authed request bind the lock, and only then restore.
    File content is device-attested, so restoring first fails on a device the
    user has legitimately just moved to.
