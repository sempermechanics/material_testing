"""Self-service seat management for institution licenses.

Institution IT drives these routes from the institution console (or curl).
Deliberately separate from `routers/admin.py`: Semper-staff mint and
whole-key revoke stay on the staff step-up path; institution IT gets a
narrower surface scoped to exactly the license(s) that name them.

Routes are served under both `/v1/institutions/*` (current) and the
pre-rename `/v1/campus/*`. The aliases exist because institution IT scripts
and curl one-liners are out of our control; drop them only after a
deprecation window (see docs/backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md §20).

Auth is `current_user` (ID token, APPROVED) plus a *verified* email present
in that specific license's `adminEmails`, **plus** the same browser step-up
every dashboard uses (completed second factor on a recent sign-in). Not
Semper `role=admin` — an institution admin has no authority outside the
licenses that name them, and cross-tenant access (institution A IT reaching
institution B's seats) 404s the same as a license that does not exist —
membership is checked before MFA so a probe learns nothing about the factor.
