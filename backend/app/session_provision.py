    one. Runs in the Cloud Tasks worker, or inline when no queue is configured.

    `purge_on_failure` is for the inline path, where no retry is coming: the
    session is rolled back completely. The queued path instead leaves it
    PROVISION_FAILED so Cloud Tasks can retry and a polling client is told to
    stop waiting.

    read again, and answers the client from the returned `uploads` (the
    targets opened here) instead of listing them back. The user doc is still
    read here: the folder pointers must come from the stored doc, not from
