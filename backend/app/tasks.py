"""Cloud Tasks: enqueue session provisioning, and authenticate the callback.

Why this exists: POST /v1/sessions used to open one Drive resumable session per
file inline. At the 600-file ceiling that is ~1200 sequential round-trips inside
a 60s Cloud Run budget, so a large analysis could not be uploaded at all. The
work now happens in a task; the request just reserves the session.

The callback is authenticated by the OIDC token Cloud Tasks attaches, verified
against the configured invoker service account. It is NOT reachable with a user
ID token or a device signature — it is not a user-facing route.
