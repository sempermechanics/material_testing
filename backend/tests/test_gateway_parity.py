"""The API Gateway spec and the FastAPI app must describe the same surface.

ESPv2 is a strict allowlist. A route that exists in the application but not in
`gateway/openapi.yaml` is simply unreachable in production — the gateway
rejects it before the container is ever consulted, and nothing in the app's
logs says why. That failure has happened twice on this codebase (the
`/v1/campus/*` aliases, then the lease routes), both times surviving code
review because both halves looked right in isolation.

The reverse direction matters less but is still a bug: a path declared at the
gateway with no handler behind it is a 404 that the gateway happily forwards.

Paths are compared with their parameter *names* erased, because the two files
spell them differently by convention — FastAPI takes `{license_id}` from the
Python signature, the gateway spec uses `{licenseId}`. Only the shape and the
methods are the contract.
