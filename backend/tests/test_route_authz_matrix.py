"""Every route's auth tier, asserted as a table, plus cross-user negative tests.

Two different jobs:

1. `test_every_route_has_the_expected_auth_tier` is a structural guard. Adding a
   route without an auth dependency is the classic silent regression — the first
   batch of endpoints gets it right and a later addition quietly does not. This
   fails on any route not listed below, so a new one cannot ship without someone
   writing down what it should be.

2. The rest exercise the boundaries against real requests. Note that
   conftest.py sets DEV_INSECURE_AUTH=1 and deps._DEV_USER is role="admin", so
   every *other* HTTP test in the suite runs as an authenticated admin with auth
   bypassed. These tests turn that off.
