"""Gap C: the second seat count.

`seatsUsed` is what institution IT believes; it moves the instant a seat is
revoked. What a revoke actually reaches is two other places — the holder's
user document, demoted outside the revoke transaction and so best-effort, and
the holder's device, which keeps working off a cached /v1/config until it next
comes back. These tests pin which of those count as settled and which do not.
