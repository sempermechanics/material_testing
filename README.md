  <strong>Material Testing</strong> — Semper DIC for tensile and bending tests

> **Lineage.** This repository was created by pushing the full history of
> [`sempermechanics/semperdic-app`](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semperdic-app)
> at `bfe00e5` (2026-09-21). It keeps the same `applicationId`
> (`com.indicvision.semper`), `google-services.json`, backend and CI, so a build
> **replaces** Semper on a device rather than installing beside it. The backend is
> deployed from the parent repo only; the deploy and Firestore workflows here have
> no environments configured and will fail if dispatched. A branch ruleset on
> `main` requires a pull request and a green `CI OK`.
>
> What this repo adds: a lab companion for a **first-semester student** doing
> the tensile and bending experiments with a phone instead of an extensometer
> or dial gauge. **New analysis** first asks for the test type — Tensile or
> Bending — then imports the loads (CSV) and the specimen dimensions that
> test's stress needs (cross-section; span / width / thickness). Tensile gives
> a **stress–strain curve and Young's modulus E** in the viewer's Results, the
> CSV and the PDFs, and **Share → Lab report (PDF)** writes the experiment up
> in the journal layout — aim, observations, table, calculation, graphs,
> results. Spec: [docs/app/STUDENT_LAB_WORKFLOW.md](docs/app/STUDENT_LAB_WORKFLOW.md).

Speckle a specimen, photograph it before and under load, and Semper computes
full-field **displacement** (U, V — ~1/100 px) and **strain** (Exx, Eyy, Exy)
on the phone. Results are interactive heatmaps plus PDF, CSV, and PNG exports.
The **C++ engine runs fully offline** (OpenCV + Eigen, NEON on device / SSE on
emulator); cloud sync is optional for signed-in testers.

| **Full-field 2D DIC** | ICGN sub-pixel solve, AKAZE + Delaunay seeding, RGDIC propagation, VSG strain |
| **Batch & video** | One reference vs many frames, or auto-extract from video |
| **ROI** | Rectangle or freehand mask |
| **Viewer & exports** | Per-field heatmaps, probe, custom scales, PDF / CSV / PNG / ZIP |
| **Cloud (optional)** | On-device queue → Google Drive via GCP backend when online — [architecture](docs/backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) |

## Who

| You are | Start here |
|---|---|
| **New developer** | This page → [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) (DIC primer) → clone below → [docs/app/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/app/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| **Contributor** | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (build, test, PR rules) + [docs/ops/CI.md](docs/ops/CI.md) when a check fails |
| **Maintainer** | [docs/ops/ENVIRONMENTS.md](docs/ops/ENVIRONMENTS.md) · [RELEASING.md](docs/ops/RELEASING.md) · [PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](docs/ops/PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md) |
| **Engine author** | [`semper-dic-engine`](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semper-dic-engine) submodule at `native/` — app contract: [docs/engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md](docs/engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md) |
| **Backend author** | [docs/backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](docs/backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) · deploy: [GCP](docs/backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md) or [Console](docs/backend/BACKEND_SETUP_CONSOLE.md) |

PRs target **`main`**. UI and docs work need no C++ toolchain. Issues tagged
`good first issue` are scoped for newcomers.

## How — build & run

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sempermechanics/material_testing
cd material_testing
git submodule update --init --recursive   # engine + Eigen/OpenCV (large, one-time)
cd native && ./scripts/sparse-opencv.sh && cd ..   # Windows: .\scripts\sparse-opencv.ps1
```

Open in Android Studio → **Run**. First build compiles OpenCV once (`app/.cxx/`
cache). **No API keys required** for local analysis; without them cloud sync
stays off. Release builds require HTTPS `INDIC_API_BASE_URL` in
`local.properties` (cloud cannot ship silently disabled).

**Emulator (x86_64):** `./gradlew :app:installDebug -PabiFilters=x86_64` — debug
boots straight to Home as a local dev account (no backend). Set
`INDIC_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false` in `local.properties` to exercise real sign-in.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where — repository map

> **The C++ engine is not in this repo.** It is pinned in
> [`native/`](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semper-dic-engine) as a git
> submodule; engine CI proves that commit. This repo proves it still **links**.

## How — analysis pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/pipeline.svg" width="720" alt="DIC pipeline: decode → seed → mesh → RGDIC → ICGN → strain → exports">
</p>

Each tracked **subset** (odd-width window) is matched with **ICGN** (6-DOF warp)
scored by **ZNSSD** (0 = perfect, ≤ 0.15 accepted — lighting-invariant). Engine
detail: `native/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` · [docs/engine/](docs/engine/).

### Parameters (Advanced in the wizard)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/subset-step.svg" width="480" alt="Subset size and step on the analysis grid">
</p>

| Parameter | Default | Range | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subset size | measured (41 px fallback) | 15–121, **odd** | Tracked window — larger = robust, less detail |
| Step size | 5 px | 1–30 | Grid spacing between points |
| Strain window | 15 px | 5–101, **odd** | VSG gauge length (displacement → strain) |

Subset width is **suggested from the reference speckle** (SSSIG criterion, Pan
et al. 2008): weak speckle → larger window. Typed evens snap to odd; out-of-range
values clamp. Override freely — **Reset** restores the suggestion.

## Test & CI

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest spotlessCheck :app:detekt :app:lintDebug
```

That is the usual app gate. Backend, emulator tier, and **engine host /
sanitizer / DICe suites run in the engine repo**, not here — this CI proves the
pinned engine still links (arm64-v8a release + x86_64 emulator).

Release gate, per-chunk tests, benchmarks, and legal-page checks:
