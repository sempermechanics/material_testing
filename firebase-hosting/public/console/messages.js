 *
 * The backend answers with a code (`backend/app/errors.py`); each page keeps
 * its own sentence for the codes that mean something particular there, and
 * falls back to the sentences below for the ones any page can meet. Codes are
 * matched exactly — `scripts/check_console.py` fails a page that matches a
 * code the backend does not declare. A code with no sentence anywhere is not
 * the message: it follows a sentence as "(ref: <code>)", for support, so
 * nothing is ever silently swallowed and nobody is shown only a code.
