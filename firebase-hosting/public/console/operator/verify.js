 *
 * The roster is a statement of intent. `seatsUsed` moves the instant IT
 * revokes a seat, so the institution's own console can only ever report
 * what IT meant to happen. This asks the backend what the licence still
 * entitles, seat by seat, and names the difference.
 *
 * Two of the answers are ordinary and one is a fault, so every row says
 * which it is in words rather than leaving a code to be looked up.
