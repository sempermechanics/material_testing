/* The dashboard switch in the header of every console page.
 *
 * An account with more than one role — Semper staff, an institution's IT
 * contact, and the account holder everyone is — has more than one
 * dashboard, and the front door forwards it to one of them. Each page used
 * to link only to the account page, and only from its "not yours" card, so
 * getting from the desk to the account meant typing the address. Every page
 * now shows one tab per dashboard the account can open, whenever there is
 * more than one.
 *
 * Decided from what the backend says on each load, the same two answers the
 * front door routes on; nothing is remembered in the browser. A page passes
 * the answer it already read, and the switch asks only for the other
 * (roles.js decides what each answer opens).
