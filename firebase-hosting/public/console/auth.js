/* Sign-in and the second factor, shared by every console page.
 *
 * The API calls themselves are `api.js`, the in-page cards `dialogs.js`, the
 * status line `status.js`; this module is what holds the Firebase SDK, so a
 * page that only draws or formats need not load it.
 *
 * The Firebase SDK is loaded from www.gstatic.com — the console CSP's
 * `script-src` names that origin (and apis.google.com, which the auth iframe
 * loads); see firebase-hosting/firebase.json. Only the project config comes
 * from Hosting's reserved namespace (/__/firebase/init.json); the SDK copies
 * under /__/firebase/<ver>/ are not used, for the reason at the imports below.
 *
 * ── Redirect, never popup ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Google sign-in and every Google re-authentication go through
 * signInWithRedirect / reauthenticateWithRedirect. A popup needs a user
 * gesture that is still fresh when the SDK opens the window, and two of the
 * places this file re-authenticates have none: straight after sign-in, to
 * enrol the second factor, and inside an API retry after `reauth_required`.
 * Browsers block those popups silently — the first staff sign-in on the live
 * domain did exactly that. A redirect has no such rule.
 *
 * The redirect flow needs the auth handler on the page's own origin, or the
 * browsers that partition third-party storage lose the result on the way
 * back. Every Hosting host — the firebaseapp.com default and a custom domain
 * alike — serves /__/auth/handler, so `authDomain` is set to the page's host
 * rather than the project default from init.json. The Google OAuth client
 * must list https://<host>/__/auth/handler as a redirect URI (README).
 *
 * There is no build step and no framework here on purpose: the site is static
 * files, and a toolchain for two pages would cost more than it saves.
 *
 * ── Why the second factor lives here ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Every state-changing /v1/admin/* route wants proof beyond an ID token. On
 * the phone that proof is a device attestation — an ECDSA signature from an
 * enrolled key. A browser cannot produce one, so the staff console proves
 * itself the other way the backend accepts: a completed second factor plus a
 * RECENT sign-in (see backend/app/deps.py attested_or_mfa_admin).
 *
 * "Recent" is the part that shapes this file. The backend rejects a token
 * whose auth_time is older than its window, so a console left open for an
 * hour must re-authenticate before it can act. `api()` (api.js) handles that
 * transparently: on `reauth_required` it re-authenticates once through `stepUp` — a redirect
 * round-trip through Google — and the operator repeats the action; a
 * `sessionStorage` note tells them so when the page comes back.
