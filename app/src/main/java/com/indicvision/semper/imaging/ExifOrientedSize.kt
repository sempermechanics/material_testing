/**
 * The pixel size a decoder that honours EXIF orientation will report, from the
 * size a decoder that ignores it reported.
 *
 * The two disagree, and the app uses both. `BitmapFactory`'s bounds-only decode
 * gives the size as stored in the file; OpenCV's `imdecode` rotates by the EXIF
 * orientation tag first (it has since 3.4.1 — `IMREAD_IGNORE_ORIENTATION`
 * exists to opt out), so for a portrait phone photo tagged ROTATE_90 the same
 * bytes measure 4080x3072 one way and 3072x4080 the other.
 *
 * That mismatch is not cosmetic: the engine decodes through OpenCV, so its view
 * is the rotated one, and any size the app records with `BitmapFactory` and then
 * compares against a size it recorded through OpenCV will disagree for the very
 * same file. Import measures deformed frames the fast way and the reference the
 * native way, which made picking one image as both sides of an analysis report
 * a size mismatch.
 *
 * The capture flow does not need this: [com.indicvision.semper.ui.capture.CaptureJpegOrient]
 * rewrites its JPEGs upright and resets the tag, so both decoders already agree
 * there.
