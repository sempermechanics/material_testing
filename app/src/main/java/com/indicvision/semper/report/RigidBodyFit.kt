/**
 * How much of a frame's displacement field is the whole scene moving, rather
 * than the specimen deforming.
 *
 * Two device runs on a tripod, with the specimen flat on a table under a fixed
 * lamp, still walked 2.3 px over sixty seconds — monotonically, which is
 * thermal, not vibration. That number has to reach the user, because it is the
 * one error in this whole chain that no camera setting touches and that only
 * they can fix.
 *
 * **It is reported and never subtracted.** A uniform translation already
 * cancels in strain, which is a spatial derivative of the displacement, so
 * removing it would change how the field *looks* without changing a single
 * strain value — the definition of a cosmetic fix. Worse, subtracting a fit
 * taken over the whole ROI would quietly remove real deformation along with
 * it, since under load the field is not rigid and the least-squares fit does
 * not know the difference. Where a genuinely undeforming region is available
 * to fit over, subtracting becomes defensible; until one is, reporting is the
 * honest half of the job and the only half worth doing.
 *
 * Pure JVM, no Android types, so the arithmetic is unit-testable.
