/**
 * Takes the static burst that decides whether this setup can measure the strain
 * about to be applied, and reduces it to a verdict.
 *
 * It runs at the end of the test shot rather than as a mode of its own, because
 * the number has to be known **before any load is applied** and a check the user
 * has to remember to run is a check that does not happen. By this point the
 * speckled specimen is mounted, framed and focused, which is what makes the
 * measurement meaningful: it is the run, minus the load.
 *
 * **The burst is captured on the run's own settings**, through
 * [LockedCameraSession] — same lens, same output size, the same frozen pipeline
 * and exposure, the same YUV → grey PNG encode. A floor measured any other way
 * describes a different camera, and a gate built on it would refuse good runs
 * and pass bad ones. That defect already exists once in this flow (the speckle
 * check runs on the vendor camera app's JPEG), and repeating it here would have
 * much worse consequences, because this measurement can stop a run.
 *
 * The first frame doubles as the pipeline warm-up the capture screen used to
 * throw away, so its cost is what sizes the rest of the burst.
