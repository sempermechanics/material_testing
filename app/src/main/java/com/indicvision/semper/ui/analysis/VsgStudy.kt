/**
 * Parameter sweep for a virtual strain gauge study — §5.4.5 of *A Good
 * Practices Guide for Digital Image Correlation* (iDICs, 2018).
 *
 * Strain is a derived quantity, so its spatial resolution is set by the
 * *virtual strain gauge*: the footprint the strain calculation averages over.
 * Too large a VSG over-smooths and biases the peak strain low; too small a VSG
 * lets displacement noise through. The guide's remedy is to re-analyse the same
 * image pair over a ladder of VSG sizes and compare the strain along a line cut
 * through the specimen — as the VSG shrinks the peak strain rises, and once it
 * stops rising the real amplitude has been resolved.
 *
 * ## Sweep space
 *
 * The three dominant variables are subset size, step size and strain window
 * (guide, Tip 5.4). The user gives a subset range and a strain-window range
 * in data points; this object derives the rest:
 *
 *  - subset sizes are the odd values across the requested range;
 *  - step size is an integer between 1/6 and 1/3 of each subset, the usual
 *    overlap band — below 1/6 neighbouring subsets are so redundant that the
 *    extra runtime buys nothing, above 1/3 the field is under-sampled.
 *    The sweep asks for that fraction as `subset ÷ N`; single analysis asks
 *    for a pixel step plus the linked overlap `1 − step/subset`;
 *  - each window's VSG in pixels then follows from its step,
 *    `(window - 1) * step + 1` ([vsgFor]), so one window gives a larger VSG
 *    at a larger subset.
 *
 * Every surviving combination is solved in its own right and lands in the
 * result viewer as its own frame, so the comparison is made on the real fields
 * rather than on a summary statistic.

    /**
     * VSG of a strain window of [points] data points at [step], in pixels:
     * `(points - 1) * step + 1`, the iDICs guide's expression for a window
     * counted in data points. The user sets the window in points; this is the
     * diameter the engine is handed, stored and reported.
     *
     * The engine reads its `strain_window` as a circle's **diameter in
     * pixels**: `radius = strain_window / 2`, each neighbour tested by its
     * distance from the centre. At this diameter the radius is
     * `(points - 1) / 2` steps plus half a pixel, so the circle takes in every
     * grid point within that many steps and no more, whatever the step.
     *
     * Two device runs confirmed that the footprint is the diameter itself
     * rather than a count of points. Solving `L = sqrt(2) * sigma_u / sigma_e`
     * from each run's own displacement jitter and strain scatter, on a static
     * specimen over 60 frames, both at a 15 px diameter:
     *
     * | device | step | measured `L` | diameter |
     * |--------|------|--------------|----------|
     * | Samsung SM-G996U1 | 3 | 13.4 px | 15 px |
     * | Pixel 6 | 5 | 10.6 px | 15 px |
     *
     * Both land just under the diameter, which is what the engine's 90%
     * support rule predicts: the outer ring is not always filled.
