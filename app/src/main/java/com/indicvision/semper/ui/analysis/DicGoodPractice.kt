/**
 * The speckle-size numbers from the iDICs *Good Practices Guide for Digital
 * Image Correlation*, and what they say about the frames a user has imported.
 *
 * These are the only literal thresholds in this work, and they are properties
 * of the method rather than of any camera: a subset correlates on the gradients
 * inside it, and a dot rendered across too few pixels has none worth solving
 * on. Everything specimen-shaped — what this pattern actually measures on this
 * frame — is measured at the moment of use by [SpeckleScale] and passed in.
 *
 * ### Why there is a ceiling as well as a floor
 *
 * The floor is the familiar half of the guidance: below [MIN_SPECKLE_PX] the
 * pattern aliases, AKAZE finds nothing to seed on and the solve returns few
 * points or none. The ceiling is the half that usually goes unsaid. Past
 * [MAX_SPECKLE_PX] the pattern is oversampled — the extra pixels carry no
 * extra correlation, but a subset must now be large to span
 * [MIN_SPECKLES_PER_SUBSET] dots, and a large subset is paid for directly in
 * spatial resolution: fewer independent measurement points across the same
 * ROI, and real strain gradients smeared across the subset. So both edges of
 * the band cost the user something, and which edge they are near decides what
 * they should change.
 *
 * Both answers are things the user fixes at the bench — camera distance, lens,
 * or the pattern itself — which is why they are worth surfacing before a run
 * rather than after it.

     * coarse pattern, and that is exactly the case worth telling the user
