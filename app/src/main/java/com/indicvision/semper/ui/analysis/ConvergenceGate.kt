/**
 * Decides when a run has lost the speckle and should stop.

 * [AnalysisViewModel.LOW_CONVERGENCE_STRIKES] consecutive solves means the image
 * pair has decorrelated, not that one frame was unlucky — the frames after it
 * will be no better, and finishing the run only spends minutes producing fields
 * nobody should trust.
 *
 * The batch path only. A sweep runs its whole plan: its consecutive solves are
 * parameter combinations on one frame pair, not successive frames, so "the next
 * one will be no better" does not follow — and the plan starts at the smallest
 * subset, the one most likely to under-converge. See [VsgStudyRunner.run].
