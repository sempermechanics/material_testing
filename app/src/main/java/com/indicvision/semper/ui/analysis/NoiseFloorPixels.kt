 * different failure modes. The probe asks what the *engine* made of a pair of
 * frames; this asks what is actually in the pixels — the image noise variance
 * `D(η)` the subset recommendation should be solving against, and the mean
 * level that exposes flicker. Neither needs a solve, and both must survive a
 * frame the platform decoder will not open.
 *
 * Every entry point returns null or NaN rather than throwing. A window that
 * would not decode costs the caller one input to the median, not a crashed test

     * pixel to pixel, so the difference of two static frames is white and this
