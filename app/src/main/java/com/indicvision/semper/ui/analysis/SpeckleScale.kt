/**
 * Measures how big the speckles are, in pixels of the frame being analysed.
 *
 * Nothing else in the app knows this number. [SubsetRecommender] measures
 * SSSIG — how much gradient a patch carries — and answers with a subset size,
 * which is a different question. SSSIG is a sum over the subset, so a pattern
 * that is too fine to resolve can still total enough gradient to clear the
 * threshold once the subset is grown, and the recommendation comes back
 * looking healthy while every dot in it spans two pixels. Speckle size is the
 * property the iDICs guidance is written against ([DicGoodPractice]), and it
 * is the one a user can act on at the bench — by moving the camera or
 * respraying the pattern — rather than by moving a slider.
 *
 * ### How the size is measured
 *
 * From the image's own autocorrelation. `rho(k)` is the Pearson correlation
 * between the window and a copy of itself shifted `k` pixels, averaged over the
 * two axes. At zero lag it is 1 by construction; it falls as the shift carries
 * a speckle off itself, and the lag where it passes half is a length scale of
 * the pattern rather than of the camera. That is the same normalised-covariance
 * loop [NoiseFloorPixels.noiseCorrelationOf] already runs at lag 1, generalised
 * to arbitrary lag and to a single frame.
 *
 * The half-height *width* is not the dot diameter, and the two must not be
 * confused. For an ideal disc of diameter `d` the autocorrelation is
 * `rho(r) = (2/pi)(acos t - t*sqrt(1 - t^2))` with `t = r/d`, which reaches 0.5
 * at `t = 0.4037` — so the width across the half-height point is `0.807 d`, and
 * the measured half-width is scaled by [AUTOCORR_TO_DIAMETER] to recover the
 * diameter. Real speckle is not a field of ideal discs, so that constant is
 * checked against a seeded synthetic pattern in `SpeckleScaleTest` rather than
 * trusted from the derivation alone.
