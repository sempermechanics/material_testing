/**
 * Names the image formats in a frame set that are not lossless.
 *
 * Correlation reads intensity per pixel, so any compression that alters
 * intensities — JPEG's blocks and chroma subsampling, lossy WebP, HEIC —
 * shifts the very quantity being measured. The warning used to test only for
 * `.jpg`/`.jpeg` and to say "JPEG detected" regardless, which was wrong in
 * both directions: a lossy WebP passed silently, and a run whose frames are
 * PNG but whose reference is a camera-app JPEG still read as though the PNGs
 * were the problem.
 *
 * Lossless is an allowlist rather than a lossy blocklist. An unrecognised
 * extension is far more likely to be some lossy container than a format worth
 * trusting silently, and the cost of asking is one dismissible chip.
