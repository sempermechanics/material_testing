/**
 * A [FrameLayout] that forces its measured height to match its measured width.
 *
 * Used for grid tiles instead of hand-computing a pixel size from the parent's
 * width: letting the grid's own layout manager measure the width (whatever it
 * actually is, including any remainder-pixel rounding) and squaring off the
 * height from that keeps the tile size in sync with wherever the layout
 * manager decided to put the column boundary, so there's no seam from a
 * mismatched manual calculation.
