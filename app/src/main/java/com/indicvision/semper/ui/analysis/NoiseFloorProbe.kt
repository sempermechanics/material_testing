/**
 * Correlates a burst of static test frames against the first one, turning each
 * pair into the [NoiseFloorStats.PairSample] the gate reasons about.
 *
 * Nothing is loaded while these frames are taken, so every displacement here is
 * error — this is the measurement that says whether the setup can see the strain
 * about to be applied, before a specimen is spent finding out.
 *
 * It is deliberately coarse. The gate needs a *scatter* over the ROI, not a
 * field: a lattice of a few hundred points estimates σ as precisely as tens of
 * thousands would, and the test shot has to still feel like a test shot. The
 * step is widened until the grid fits [TARGET_GRID_POINTS], never narrowed.
 *
 * Every failure path returns fewer samples rather than throwing. A burst that
 * could not be correlated is the *existing* speckle failure — the caller
 * already has a dialog for it — and must never be a new crash.

     * engine's 90% support rule allows. The grid's outer ring has no neighbours
     * and drops; the interior is what σ is measured on.
