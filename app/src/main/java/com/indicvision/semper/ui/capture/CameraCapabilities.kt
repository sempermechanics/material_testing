/**
 * Catalogue of back-camera output sizes from Camera2, with the sensor's own
 * floor on how fast each size can be read out.
 *
 * That floor is per-resolution, not per-device: [StreamConfigurationMap]
 * reports a minimum frame duration and a stall duration for each (format,
 * size) pair, and a full-sensor read is slower than a binned one on the same
 * hardware. A single device-wide "max fps" — which is what the AE target-fps
 * ranges give you — cannot express that, and reading it at full resolution
 * promised rates the sensor was never going to deliver.
 *
 * Durations are queried for YUV_420_888 because that is the format the locked
 * session actually requests (see [LockedCameraSession]); the JPEG figures
 * describe the hardware JPEG encoder, which this path does not use.
 *
 * [Info.yuvSizes] keeps only 4:3-shaped sizes (see [preferFourByThree]) and is
 * bounded by [sustainableCeiling] — DIC decisions, not hardware ones; see
 * those.
