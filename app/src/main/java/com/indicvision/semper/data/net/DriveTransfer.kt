 *   fewer, larger windows cut real Firestore-quota cost.
 * - Progress reporting is per-window ([onBytes] fires once a window lands), so
 *   an oversized window on a slow link also makes restore progress look stuck.
 *
 * [nextWindowBytes] adapts the size after every completed window toward
 * [TARGET_WINDOW_SECONDS] of transfer at the just-observed throughput, so a
