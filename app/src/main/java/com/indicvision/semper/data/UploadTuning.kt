 * The server declares [serverChunkSize] (currently a flat 32 MiB —

 * `isLowRamDevice` alone is a blunt signal: it is a fixed, device-class boolean,
 * unaware of what else is resident right now (a memory-heavy DIC batch still in
 * the session directory, another foreground app) — where [concurrency] may
 * already be reduced to 1 but each of those single chunks could still be the
 * full 32 MiB the server offered.
 *
 * Reading live `ActivityManager.MemoryInfo.availMem` instead budgets against
 * *actual* headroom at upload time: [concurrency] chunk buffers must together
 * stay within [CHUNK_MEMORY_BUDGET_FRACTION] of what's available right now.
 * Drive's resumable PUT declares its own Content-Range per request, so nothing
 * about the protocol requires a fixed chunk size across a transfer — shrinking
 * it here is always safe, and
 * [com.indicvision.semper.data.net.drive.DriveTransfer.uploadResumable] re-clamps to
 * [MIN_CHUNK_BYTES]/[MAX_CHUNK_BYTES] regardless, so a missing/zero `availMem`
 * reading (some OEM ROMs) falls back to exactly the old behavior — the server's
 * own value, clamped.
 *
 * Top-level so it is directly unit-testable — mirrors
 * [com.indicvision.semper.data.net.drive.nextWindowBytes] in `DriveTransfer.kt`.
