 * Nothing is cached: the first call after one has finished starts a new one. The
 * shared call runs in [scope], not in any caller, so a caller that gives up (its
 * screen closed) cancels only its own wait; the others still get the answer. A
 * failure reaches every caller that joined it, and the next call tries again.
