/**
 * The `role` strings the client puts on every uploaded artifact.
 *
 * Mirrors `Role` in `backend/app/models.py`, which is a `Literal[…]` — the
 * backend rejects anything outside the set, and the restore path routes a
 * downloaded file by the role it was stored under. The two lists are pinned
 * against each other by `backend/tests/test_wire_vocabulary.py`.
 *
 * Without that pin a role rename deploys green on both sides and breaks restore
 * silently: the upload succeeds under the new name, and the restore matcher —
 * which still compares against the old one — routes the file nowhere. The
 * comment on `FileSpecDto.role` had already drifted four values behind the
 * backend before this object existed, which is the same drift starting.
