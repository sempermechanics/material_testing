 * (`backend/app/rate_limit.py`) and the API Gateway quota both reject *before*
 * the handler runs, so nothing happened and a repeat is not a second write.
 *
 * **503 is not the same promise.** ESPv2 emits it both before and after handing
 * the request on, so it is retried only for GET and for the POSTs whose
 * handlers are idempotent by contract — seat checkout *is* the heartbeat, and a
 * release that frees nothing still succeeds. Session create and the upload
 * broker are deliberately absent: a duplicate there costs a Drive object.
 *
 * Bounded on purpose. Where a call is worker-mediated, `Result.retry()` and
 * WorkManager's own [androidx.work.BackoffPolicy] own the long game; this layer
 * exists for the interactive calls that have no second chance — taking a seat,
 * a settings action, an admin screen — which until now surfaced a one-second
 * throttle to the user as a flat failure.
 *
 * Mirrors `backend/app/drive.py`, which honours `Retry-After` the same way for
 * the backend's own egress.
