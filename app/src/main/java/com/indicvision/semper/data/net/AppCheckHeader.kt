/**
 * Attaches a Firebase App Check token to Semper backend calls.
 *
 * The token answers a question no other credential on the request does: the ID
 * token proves *which account*, the device signature proves *which device*, and
 * this proves *which binary* — that the caller is a genuine, unmodified build
 * rather than a script holding a valid sign-in. The Web API key that mints ID
 * tokens ships inside the APK and is an identifier, not a secret, so nothing
 * else on the wire can make that claim.
 *
 * **Scoped to the API host.** Drive uploads and downloads share this client and
 * go to Google's own endpoints, which have no use for the header and no reason
 * to be told this project's App Check state.
 *
 * **Fails open.** A build with no registered attestation — a developer's APK, a
 * device whose Play Integrity is unavailable — sends no header instead of a
 * failed call. That is why the backend defaults to `APP_CHECK_MODE=off` and
 * offers `monitor`: the fleet is measured before anything is refused, and the
 * decision to reject stays on the server, which is the only side that can be
 * trusted to make it.
 *
 * Both constructor arguments carry production defaults; they exist so a test
 * can supply a host and a token without a Firebase app behind it.
