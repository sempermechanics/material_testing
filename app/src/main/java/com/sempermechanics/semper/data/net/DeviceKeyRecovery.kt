 * Puts this device's public key back on the backend after a device-signed call
 * is refused `401 bad_signature`, so the call can be sent once more.
 *
 * The backend keeps one key per device id (`devices/{deviceId}`), and Android
 * gives every app signed with one key the same `ANDROID_ID`, so another app on
 * this phone that registers (a retired `com.indicvision.*` build, a debug build
 * of Material Testing) replaces our key. Every signed call then fails
 * `bad_signature`, and the `device_registered` flag kept sign-in from ever
 * registering again (TD-209).
 *
 * Registering again is [reRegister], the sign-in's `POST /v1/devices/register`.
 * For the same device id on the same account the backend only rewrites the
 * key and the device record (`DEVICE_REBIND` in the audit): no device is
 * retired, no licence or seat lock moves.
 *
 * One process-wide instance ([SemperApi] is a singleton), so parallel calls
 * share one registration: see [recover].
