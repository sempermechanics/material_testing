 *
 * - A slow link must stay well under the 300s budget — a window sized for a
 *   fast connection would time out and lose all its bytes on a slow one.
 * - A fast link benefits from a bigger window: each window costs a fresh
 *   attestation challenge (Firestore read+write+delete + an audit write), so
 *   fewer, larger windows cut real Firestore-quota cost.
 * - Progress reporting is per-window ([onBytes] fires once a window lands), so
 *   an oversized window on a slow link also makes restore progress look stuck.
 *
 * [nextWindowBytes] adapts the size after every completed window toward
 * [TARGET_WINDOW_SECONDS] of transfer at the just-observed throughput, so a
 * slow link naturally stays small (frequent progress, cheap retries) and a
 * fast one grows toward [MAX_DOWNLOAD_WINDOW_BYTES] (fewer requests) — without
