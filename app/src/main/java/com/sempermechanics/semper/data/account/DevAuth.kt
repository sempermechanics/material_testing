/**
 * Debug-only sign-in bypass for emulator runs.
 *
 * Working on the UI in an emulator otherwise means a real Google/Firebase
 * sign-in against an approved backend account — awkward on a machine with no
 * Play Services account, and pointless for screens that never touch the cloud.
 * When [active], the app boots straight to Home as a local-only dev account.
 *
 * Three independent conditions must all hold, so this can never reach a user:
 *  1. `BuildConfig.DEBUG` — release builds are compiled without it,
 *  2. `BuildConfig.DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` — hardcoded false for the release build
 *     type, and switchable off with `SEMPER_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false` in
 *     local.properties to test the real sign-in flow on an emulator,
 *  3. the app is running on an emulator, not a physical device.
 *
 * While it is active, [com.sempermechanics.semper.data.net.SemperApi.enabled] reports
 * the cloud as disabled: with no Firebase user there is no ID token, so every
 * backend call would fail anyway (and the upload worker would retry forever).
 * The bypass therefore gives a purely offline app — cloud backup, restore and
 * account screens behave exactly as they do with no SEMPER_API_BASE_URL set.
