/**
 * One deformed frame the wizard holds: its staged [path], the [name] the user
 * picked it as, its best-effort capture [date] ([UNKNOWN_DATE] when unknown,
 * which sorts last), its pixel [size] (null until measured), and, for a
 * frame sampled from a video, its time in the clip [timeMs] (null otherwise).
 *
 * The lab tests add what a load is matched by: a photo's EXIF
 * [captureTimeMs] (`PhotoCaptureTime`; null without one) and bending's
 * [typedLoadKg] (null: a box left blank). A video frame is matched by
 * [timeMs] less the reference's clip time (`AnalysisViewModel.refVideoTimeMs`).
 * They ride with the frame like the rest, so a load follows its photo when
 * the list is reordered.
 *
 * A batch is a `List<DeformedFrame>` in run order, so a frame's name, date,
 * size and time move with it whenever the list is reordered. The wizard's draft
 * (`WizardState.Frames`) and the view model's read-only list views keep the
 * older parallel-list shape; [unzip] makes it.
