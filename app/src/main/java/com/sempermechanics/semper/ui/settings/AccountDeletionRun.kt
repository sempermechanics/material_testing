/**
 * The one account deletion in flight, held outside any screen.
 *
 * Settings has no `configChanges`, so a rotation destroys and recreates it.
 * Run on the Activity's `lifecycleScope`, the deletion was cancelled half-way
 * (cloud erased, local data and sign-in still there) and its progress dialog
 * leaked with the old window. Here it runs on an application-lifetime scope,
 * and whichever Settings instance is showing renders [state] — the progress
 * dialog while [State.Running], then the outcome once ([consume]).
 *
 * Process death still ends the run, so how far it got is kept on disk
 * ([AccountDeletionMarker]): the stage is written before the erase is sent and
 * when it answers, and cleared once nothing more is owed. The next process
 * finishes what is left ([resumeInterrupted], from `SemperApp`): an erase that
 * answered is followed by the wipe and sign-out; one that never answered is
 * settled by asking the backend whether the account is gone
 * ([CloudErase.probeErasedAccount]) — wiped if it is, left alone if it is
 * still there, asked again at the next start when there is no answer.
