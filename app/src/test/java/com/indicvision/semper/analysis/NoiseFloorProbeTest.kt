/**

 * The engine will not hand back a displacement whose strain it could not
 * compute — the point is dropped from the output entirely, u and v with it — so
 * a strain window sized for the analysis rather than for this deliberately
 * coarse lattice does not merely produce worse strain. It produces **nothing**,
 * on every point, which is a burst that measures as zero and a gate that
 * silently concludes it cannot conclude. That happened on both test devices,
 * and this is the test that would have caught it.
