# Architecture decision records

One file per decision that is expensive to rediscover and easy to undo by
accident. Format: Status / Context / Decision / Options / Trade-offs /
Consequences / Action items. A superseded record stays; its status names the
record that replaced it.

Register IDs refer to [../ops/TECH_DEBT.md](../ops/TECH_DEBT.md). ADR-008, ADR-009,
ADR-011, ADR-012 and ADR-013 are material_testing's (ADR-008's benchmark harness and ADR-013's backend route live here too: the harness is shared code, and the backend deploys from this repo); the numbers are shared so they do not collide.
