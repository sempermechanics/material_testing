# Architecture decision records

One file per decision that is expensive to rediscover and easy to undo by
accident. Format: Status / Context / Decision / Options / Trade-offs /
Consequences / Action items. A superseded record stays; its status names the
record that replaced it.

| [028](ADR-028-tamper-evident-records.md) | A signed sidecar manifest (`record_manifest.json`: run spec, app and engine pin, SHA-256 per `.dat`, signed with the device key) makes a measurement record tamper-evident without changing a `.dat` byte; it travels in `Session.zip` under `dat/` | Accepted, built (not merged) | TD-247 (closed by it) |

Register IDs refer to [../ops/TECH_DEBT.md](../ops/TECH_DEBT.md); one no longer listed there is closed, and its history is in git. ADR-008, ADR-009,
ADR-011 (ported here), ADR-012 and ADR-013 are material_testing's (ADR-008's benchmark harness and ADR-013's backend route live here too: the harness is shared code, and the backend deploys from this repo); the numbers are shared so they do not collide. One did: material_testing's ADR-022 (Semper's UI plus two test choices, 2026-10-14) and this repo's ADR-022 (re-run as a copy, 2026-10-15) share a number; ADR-025 names the fork's by its file name.
