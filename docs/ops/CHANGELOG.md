# Changelog

The history that used to live under "Current state" in
[CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md), moved here on 2026-09-23 so the agent map stays
short. Entries are newest first; the text is as it stood in CONTEXT.md, with
relative links re-pointed for this folder and dated `[Note …]` corrections
where a statement had gone stale. Headings and dates are added; undated entries
keep the order CONTEXT.md gave them. Git history and PR descriptions remain the
source of truth: `gh pr list --state all`, and `git log -p CONTEXT.md` for the
text as it evolved.
Decisions that outlive their PR are recorded in
[CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) §20,
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../app/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [../adr/](../adr/).

## 2026-10-23 — Backend, gateways and the console: #466–#468; main green again

The backend from `main` at `d79aa0c7` went live: staging first, then production with the
required reviewer's approval (TD-228). That deploy carries #466, #467 and #468; the other
PRs merged since `b940cc29` change no runtime backend code. Hosting followed with the
console's per-phone **Release**. No Firestore index deploy, no app release.

- **Staging.** Run 39900999296 (`semper-api-staging-39900999296-1`, 100 %). The gateway job
  found `semper-gw-staging` already serving this spec (config `v202610221243-110`, applied
  by CI on `main`) and changed nothing.
- **Tier 3 on `main`.** It had failed twice after #470, though the same tree passed on the
  PR: staging still ran `f2a58466`, which predates #464's CI-phone rotation, so
  `POST /v1/devices/register` answered 409 once the CI test account's phones were full.
  After the staging deploy, attempt 3 of run 39775004430 passed (register 201, round trip
  200s) and `CI OK` went green.
- **Production.** Run 39900623312 (`semper-api-39900623312-1`, 100 %), with
  `CHECK_REVOKED_ON_STEP_UP=true` live (TD-214; its acceptance check is still owed). The
  gateway diff against `v202610220502-104` added one path,
  `POST /v1/admin/test-accounts/{uid}/devices/{device_id}/release` (#468); config
  `v202610230501-112` now serves `semper-gw` and its outside check passed. An anonymous
  call to the new path answers 401 `Jwt is missing`; an undefined path answers 404. A
  second production dispatch of the same commit (run 39900805964) was cancelled.
- **Live now:** a Firestore outage answers 503 `firestore_unreachable` with `Retry-After`
  (#466, TD-250); new audit rows carry `expireAt` for one-year retention (#467, TD-237; the
  TTL policy, the TD-246 backfill and the index deploy are still the operator's,
  [checklist](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md) §6); staff can release one phone of a test
  account (#468, TD-314).
- **Hosting.** `scripts/deploy-console.sh` from `main` at `d79aa0c7` put the operator desk's
  **Release** live (`console/operator/test-accounts.js`, 07:43 UTC). That deploy also
  published #474's Privacy and Terms text, which waits on counsel (TD-277). At 07:51 UTC
  the operator redeployed from a worktree at `d79aa0c7` with
  `firebase-hosting/public/{privacy,terms}/index.html` checked out from `b940cc29`; the live
  pages then matched `b940cc29` byte for byte, `test-accounts.js` still carried
  `data-ta-release`, and `check_live_console.py` passed. At 08:06 UTC the operator
  deployed the redesigned operator desk (#478) the same way, from `main` at `000575b0`
  with the two legal pages from `b940cc29`; the live console files and both legal pages
  matched that tree byte for byte, and `check_live_console.py` passed.
- **TD-314 on staging** (QC test account, emulators): staff released
  `and-36439a0f18da2a33` in the console (audit `test_account_device_released`, 07:45:50 UTC);
  after **Refresh licence** that phone showed "Still on the demo" with backup and data
  management locked; its re-registration answered 409 `device_conflict`, audited
  `DEVICE_REGISTER` DENIED `reason=staff_released` (07:49:00 UTC); a third emulator
  (`and-100a171151b8fdb0`) registered once the CI rotation had freed its id. The app shows
  the generic "already linked to another account" message for a released phone.
- **Merged the same days, nothing to deploy:** #472 (Current state condensed; the first
  `check_gcp_posture.sh` run, 18 FAIL, and the §5 monitoring dry run recorded) and #473 (the
  audit-repo path test passes on Windows).

The Current state entry this deploy closes, as it stood:

- **Backend on `main`, not deployed:** #466 (a Firestore outage answers 503, TD-250), #467
  (one-year audit retention: `expireAt`, TTL, backfill; TD-237, TD-246) and #468 (staff
  release one test-account phone, TD-314; a new gateway route). `CHECK_REVOKED_ON_STEP_UP`
  is set and goes live with that deploy (TD-214).

## 2026-10-22 — Backend, gateways and Hosting: the readiness change, #457 and test accounts

Everything from `main` at `b940cc29` went live, in [checklist](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md)
order: Firestore indexes, staging, production, the expiry jobs, Hosting. Monitoring (§5)
and the after-deploy steps (§6) have not run yet.

- **Before the backend.** The repo variable `TEST_ACCOUNT_DOMAINS` is
  `qa.sempermechanics.com`, so staff can make test accounts only on that subdomain
  ([ADR-027](../adr/ADR-027-test-accounts.md)). `indic-api@` holds
  `roles/firebaseauth.admin` on `indicvision-dic-app-auth`, which is also the TD-214 grant.
  The Cloud Scheduler API is on in `indicvision-dic-app`.
- **Firestore indexes.** `scripts/deploy-firestore.sh indexes` failed before creating
  anything (TD-316). The two missing composites, `audit_logs (licenseId ASC, ts DESC)`
  and `files (uid, sessionId)`, went in with `gcloud firestore indexes composite create`.
  The `seats.uid` and `deleted_seats.uid` collection-group overrides went in with a REST
  `PATCH …/collectionGroups/{seats,deleted_seats}/fields/uid?updateMask=indexConfig` that
  sets the file's four indexes. All six composites and both overrides were READY, and the
  three TTL policies still ACTIVE, before the backend.
- **Staging.** Run 39722458180 (gateway dry run, `semper-api-staging-39722458180-1`), then
  run 39723097621 (apply, config `v202610220438-102`). `/readyz` answered 200 (Firestore
  and Drive ok). The gateway diff added 14 paths: `/v1/me/claim`,
  `/v1/admin/licenses/search`, the admin and institution `seats/import`, `seats/export`,
  `summary` and `audit` routes, and the four `/v1/admin/test-accounts` routes. It removed
  only description text and added neither task callback. After the apply, anonymous calls
  to the new paths answered 401 and `POST /v1/tasks/test-account-expiry` answered 404.
- **Production.** Run 39724590027 (`semper-api-39724590027-1`, 100 % after `/readyz`
  answered 200), with the same gateway diff as staging. Then run 39725270944 applied
  config `v202610220502-104` to `semper-gw`; anonymous calls to the new paths answer 401.
- **Expiry jobs.** `semper-test-account-expiry` and `semper-test-account-expiry-staging`
  run daily at 03:17 UTC, POST to their service's `/v1/tasks/test-account-expiry` with an
  OIDC token from `indic-api@`, audience the service URL. A manual run of each succeeded.
- **Hosting.** The operator ran `scripts/deploy-console.sh` from `main` and
  `check_live_console.py` passed.

The Current state entries this deploy closes, as they stood:

- **Deployed.** Cloud Run `semper-api` behind API Gateway `semper-gw`, and staging
  `semper-api-staging` behind `semper-gw-staging`, from `c295639d` (2026-10-14; gateways
  unchanged; Firestore deadlines #432, TD-210; backups by name #429).
- **Readiness change merged, not deployed** (#448, #449; `main` @ `763ed7a` with the
  docs-only #454–#456): the cross-check ([gate](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md#framework-cross-check-2026-10-18),
  TD-214–TD-278, FI-17–FI-24), [ADR-023](../adr/ADR-023-signed-offline-entitlement.md),
  **minSdk 30**, version gate, EMM config, IT roster tools, audit export, AAB, monitoring as
  code and account-anchored entitlements ([ADR-024](../adr/ADR-024-account-anchored-entitlements.md)).
  No release built from it. Owed at deploy, in [checklist](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md)
  order: indexes, backend, gateway, Hosting, monitoring; also TD-214, TD-215, TD-219, TD-226,
  TD-229–TD-232, counsel on the Terms (TD-277).
- **#457 merged, not deployed** (`main` @ `f5396c2`: the 2026-10-19 review and two tech-debt
  rounds; closed TD-171, 198, 207, 281–293, 295–297, 306–308). Backend: device trust levels
  (ADR-010 amendment), `step_up.py` and `services/`, a new-device mail, projected listings, a
  licence fan-out finished by a Cloud Task ([ADR-026](../adr/ADR-026-licence-fanout-marker.md)),
  `audit_logs` append-only in code and mirrored to Cloud Logging. App: uploads resume only on
  the declared sha256, a failed batch undone, `WizardInputs` edited whole, viewer hosts, screen
  work in ViewModels, retriever frames timed as decoded; CI checks file size, ADR-016 rule 1 and
  swallowed cancellation; [ADR-025](../adr/ADR-025-test-type-extension-points.md) proposed.
  At deploy ([checklist](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md)): TOTP re-registration, C1/C2,
  `NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM` (TD-309), `TASKS_QUEUE` (TD-294), the audit bucket lock (TD-237).
  Left: TD-237, TD-246, TD-294, TD-298, TD-299, TD-309.
- **Open: `ccr-603fe346-1bw2fa`**: staff test accounts for QC and CI
  ([ADR-027](../adr/ADR-027-test-accounts.md)); off until `TEST_ACCOUNT_DOMAINS` is set.
  [Note 2026-10-22: merged as #460 on 2026-10-20.]

## 2026-10-17 — App release `v1.2-beta.4`

Release run 39064532280 on `main` at `33dce87d`, after full-matrix CI run 39061205386
passed on that commit (tiers 1, 3, 4 and 5). It produced a signed APK, versionCode 1036,
and the private GitHub pre-release `v1.2-beta.4`. The build carries the 169 PRs merged
since `v1.2-beta.3` and engine `23034fe` (0.4.2, #445 and #446). It is the first release
as `com.sempermechanics.semper` ([ADR-019](../adr/ADR-019-sempermechanics-app-id.md)),
so it installs beside `com.indicvision.semper`, not over it, and backups restore into it.
Once it registers, the old id is refused (410 `app_retired`, #427), and the old app's
signed calls fail on that phone. The release notes therefore tell testers to back up in
the old app first. Not yet smoked on a device. The Current state entry this release
closes, as it stood:

- **App release `v1.2-beta.3`** (beta, versionCode 35, from `ae05bb87`). On `main` and not
  in a release yet: the quality program (#310–#332;
  [QUALITY_PROGRAM_RESULTS.md](QUALITY_PROGRAM_RESULTS.md)); security and data-loss
  fixes (#393–#400); the UI pass (#385–#396) and the minimal pass (#402–#419); tech-debt
  fixes (#404–#411, #425); unique analysis names (#426); device key recovery (#427; the
  shared key slot stays open, TD-209); and the 2026-10-13/14 fixes #428, #429 (the app
  sends the name), #430, #431, #433, #434 (backup schema `/4`) and #435 (exports drawn
  on the deformed frame), and #445 (engine `3e3a785`, 0.4.1: anchor-lattice seeding,
  incremental DIC, all 23 metrics slots through the JNI). Open: the pin to `23034fe` (0.4.2:
  the lattice is seeded with rotation and scale, Fourier–Mellin; no JNI change).

## 2026-10-14 — Backend deploy: Firestore call deadlines (#432), backups listed by the analysis's name (#429)

Staging run 38538685399 (`semper-api-staging-38538685399-1`) and production run
38541490118 (`semper-api-38541490118-1`) from `c295639d`, started by the operator.
Production's `/readyz` answered ok and the new revision took 100 %; the gateways
were not changed (no route or spec change since `v202610091239-93` /
`v202610091241-94`). `main` has moved on to `8ba7081c` (#435), which changes no
backend file.

What changed for callers:
- **Firestore call deadlines (#432, TD-197).** Every Firestore call in `backend/app`
  goes through a helper in `repo/_base.py` with a timeout and a matching retry window:
  10 s for a get or a write, 20 s for a query, `.count()` or `get_all`, about twice
  that at worst, under the gateway's 60 s. Before, a hung call held a threadpool thread
  for minutes after the gateway had answered 504. A transaction's begin and commit take
  no timeout in the client's public API and keep its 60 s default (TD-210);
  [CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) §10.1.
- **Backup names (#429, TD-208).** `POST /v1/sessions` takes an optional `name`, the
  listing returns it, and a metadata PUT with a non-blank `name` renames the session.
  The app lists `name` and falls back to `specimen` (the reference's file name) when it
  is empty. Backups made before this deploy, or by a build without #429 (every
  installed release until the next one), have no `name`, so they show the file name
  until a #429 build renames them or backs them up again; both re-send the metadata. No
  backfill: the state clears itself as builds update. The account console's name column
  needs a Hosting deploy (`scripts/deploy-console.sh`), not yet done.

Merged 2026-10-13/14, not part of the backend image, for the next app release
([TECH_DEBT.md](TECH_DEBT.md) rows deleted in each):
- #428 (TD-153): reconcile asks `?app=all` once when a SYNCED row is missing from its
  own list, so an analysis restored from the other app's backup stays SYNCED instead of
  uploading again ([ADR-014](../adr/ADR-014-session-app-tag.md)).
- #429's app half: backups send the analysis's name; lists show it.
- #430 (TD-173): a run's reference and frames are frozen at launch (`RunInputs`), so the
  batch loop and the sweep no longer read mutable view-model fields
  ([ADR-004](../adr/ADR-004-runspec.md)).
- #431 (TD-154, TD-207 narrowed): video frames keep the decoded frame's own clip time on
  the hardware and AVI rungs, and Key frames mode works on every rung. The retriever
  rung still records the time asked for (TD-207).
- #433 (TD-170): dispatchers are injected per instance; no mutable companion dispatcher
  is left in main code.
- #434 (TD-163, TD-164, TD-169): `Session.zip` stages the reference as
  `ref/Reference.png` (upload schema `/3` → `/4`); unrecorded skip codes stay null;
  the 15 px strain window for records without one is kept on purpose. An app older than
  `/4` restores a `/4` backup without its reference, so material_testing must take the
  reader before the writer at its next sync.
- #435 (TD-139): the PNG export, the PDF report and the summary GIF draw each frame on
  its own photo at the displaced positions, as the viewer does
  ([ADR-011](../adr/ADR-011-viewer-deformed-frame.md)). The GIF goldens were regenerated;
  `field_small.dat` is unchanged. Its Pixel 6 benchmarks are owed.

## 2026-10-10 — Backend deploy: retired app ids refused at registration (#427)

Staging run 38032218283 and production run 38032569176 from `a462755f` (`main` after
#425), started by the operator. `POST /v1/devices/register` answers `410 app_retired`
(audited `DEVICE_REGISTER` / `DENIED`) to a retired `com.indicvision.*` `X-App-Id`,
since such a build reports the device id of the app that succeeded it on the same
phone and would replace that app's key. The app half of #427 (a signed call refused
`bad_signature` registers the key again and is re-sent once, `DeviceKeyRecovery`) waits
for the next app release. Two apps signed with one key still share a key slot (TD-209).

## 2026-10-10 — The first Firestore restore drill passed; backend redeploy from `bd1246c3`

**Restore drill (TD-156, #404, #411, #422).** No export had ever been restored.
- The operator ran `scripts/setup-restore-drill.sh` on 2026-10-09. It created the
  drill project `indicvision-dic-restore-drill`, its asia-south1 database, the
  `restore-drill@` identity (Firestore owner on the drill project only, reached
  through the `github` WIF pool) and the five `restore-drill` variables.
- Two first runs failed:
  - The new identity's WIF binding had not propagated: `getAccessToken` answered 403.
  - The import checks `storage.buckets.get` on the backup bucket, which
    `objectViewer` does not grant. The operator added `legacyBucketReader` for the
    drill identity and the drill's Firestore agent, and the script now grants it and
    retries the steps a new project makes slow (#411).
- Run 38023354431 passed: export `20261009T090852Z` imported in **111 s (the RTO)**.
  Every collection count and a 25-session relationship sample matched the export's
  manifest, and the drill database was purged. Recorded in
  [PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md); the drill runs monthly.

**Backend redeploy**, runs 38023338217 (staging) and 38023582092 (production) from
`bd1246c3`, started by the operator. No backend file changed since `029a12c4` (entry
below): both smokes passed, new revisions took 100 %, and each gateway job found that
the live config already served the spec (`v202610091239-93` staging,
`v202610091241-94` production).

## 2026-10-09 — Backend and gateway deploy: the app id in the access log, JSON log lines, one status per refusal (#409)

Staging run 37931002871 and production run 37931251516 from `029a12c4`, started by the
operator, `gateway_mode: apply`. Both smokes passed (`/readyz`, `firestore: ok`);
`semper-api-37931251516-1` took 100 %. The gateways switched to `v202610091239-93`
(staging) and `v202610091241-94` (production).

What changed for callers (#409):
- **Access log:** every line names the app id the call sent (`appId`: a listed id,
  `none` or `unknown`; TD-176 step 1).
- **Log lines:** on Cloud Run each is one JSON object with a `severity`, so Cloud
  Logging stores `jsonPayload` and the documented `jsonPayload.*` filters and alerts
  can match. Lines from before this deploy stay `textPayload`.
- **`/v1/config`:** sends `licensePrefix` only while the licence is the effective mode
  (TD-145). `/v1/me` is unchanged.
- **Gateway:** `page_size` and `page_token` are declared on `/uploads` and `/files`
  (TD-159).
- **Refusals:** `license_revoked` is 403 and `license_seat_disabled` 409 on every route
  (TD-185, [ADR-020](../adr/ADR-020-backend-refusal-model.md)).

Checked on 2026-10-10: production access lines carry `appId`
(`com.sempermechanics.semper` and `com.sempermechanics.materialtesting` seen; no
`com.indicvision.*` yet).

## 2026-10-09 — Backend and gateway deploy: the account-erasure check (#400)

Staging run 37923499929 and production run 37923748503 from `ae5f4ec4`, started by the
operator, `gateway_mode: apply`. Both smokes passed; `semper-api-37923748503-1` took
100 %. The gateways switched to `v202610091128-91` (staging) and `v202610091130-92`
(production).

What changed for callers:
- **`GET /v1/me/erasure`** (TD-206): whether this phone's device record is gone or
  someone else's, for the app's check after an account deletion that never answered.
  It reads the ID token alone (`deps.token_uid`), so asking does not re-create an
  erased account's profile. Answers 401 without a token through the gateway.
- Also in this build, tests only: real Firebase ID tokens verified end to end
  (TD-201), the ops scripts' tests (TD-202), the account-deletion probe pins (TD-165).

## 2026-10-08 — Backend deploys with `gateway_mode: apply`: both gateways' configs re-encoded

**Why:** the hand deploy of 2026-10-07 created `v202610070547-manual` (staging) and
`v202610070628-manual` (production) with mis-encoded text. Every `—` and `→` in their
description text read as `â€”` and `â†’`, the 29 lines the dry-runs of #375's deploys
reported (entry below). Routes and security were not affected. Both runs below
rendered `backend/gateway/openapi.yaml` and switched the gateway to a fresh config.
No backend file changed after #375's deploy (`b6ee1544`), so each new revision runs
the same code.

**Staging**, run 37775762411 from `4dd18929`:
- The candidate passed `/readyz` (`firestore: ok`, `drive: ok`).
  `semper-api-staging-37775762411-1` took 100 %, and the images were re-pinned.
- `semper-gw-staging` switched from `v202610070547-manual` to `v202610081220-89`.

**Production**, run 37776947585 from `06c425bd`, started by the operator (#381, in
between, changed only console tests and CI):
- The same smoke passed. `semper-api-37776947585-1` took 100 %, and the images were
  re-pinned.
- `semper-gw` switched from `v202610070628-manual` to `v202610081230-90`.

**Checked on both:**
- **The workflow's outside check:** `GET /v1/config` answers 401 without a token,
  and the preflight answers 200.
- **The new configs**, read back with `gcloud api-gateway api-configs describe --view
  FULL`: no mis-encoded sequence, and 28 `—` and one `→`, as in the source.
- **The dashboards' preflight** still answers `access-control-max-age: 7200`.

The `-manual` configs stay as each gateway's rollback target.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting and backend deploys: a page-not-found page, and the CORS preflight cached for two hours (#375)

Hosting and staging from `cfa057c8` (`main` after #375). Production from `b6ee1544`:
the commits between them, #377 and #378, change only Hosting and docs, so production
ran the same backend code as staging.

**Hosting**, with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` against `semper-gw`: one file uploaded,
`public/404.html`, and the script's live check found the gateway filled in.
- `/nope-xyz` and `/console/operator/nope` on `app.sempermechanics.com` now answer
  404 with "This page doesn't exist". Before, they got Firebase's stock page.
- The page goes to `/login` after 5 s, with a bar and a Go there now link. It uses
  no script, so it works under the `/console/**` policy too.
- `/console/config.js` and the CSP on `/login` carry no `__API_…` placeholder.

**Staging backend**, `deploy-backend.yml` run 37773100006, gateway `dry-run`:
- The candidate passed the `/readyz` smoke (`firestore: ok`, `drive: ok`).
  `semper-api-staging-37773100006-1` took 100 %, and the serving and rollback images
  were re-pinned.
- `semper-gw-staging` answers the dashboards' preflight with
  `access-control-max-age: 7200`. The origin, methods and headers are unchanged.
- **Gateway:** the dry-run diff against the live `v202610070547-manual` config
  showed 29 changed lines. All are `—` and `→` in description text, which the live
  config holds mis-encoded (`â€”`, `â†’`) since the 2026-10-07 hand deploy. There is no
  route or security change, so no gateway update is needed for #375.

**Production backend**, `deploy-backend.yml` run 37774012180, gateway `dry-run`,
started by the operator:
- The candidate passed the same smoke. `semper-api-37774012180-1` took 100 %, and the
  serving and rollback images were re-pinned.
- `semper-gw` answers the preflight with `access-control-max-age: 7200`; it answered
  `600` before the run.
- The dry-run against `v202610070628-manual` showed the same 29 encoding-only lines,
  so `semper-gw` is unchanged.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploy: the default CSP runs no inline script (#377, TD-204)

#377 (`05f71c58`) was deployed with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` and the live check
passed. The default `**` policy is now `script-src 'self'` (it allowed
`'unsafe-inline'`, which no page needed after `finishReset` moved to `reset.js`).
Live after the deploy: `/terms/`, `/privacy/`, `/finishSignIn/` and `/finishReset/`
send `script-src 'self'`; `/console/` and `/login` keep their own policy; Firebase's
`/__/auth/handler` sends no custom CSP. In a browser on the live site `finishReset`
filled its link, Terms rendered and `/login` reached its signed-out state, with no
CSP violation logged. `check_console.py` check 11 keeps every policy and page that way.

## 2026-10-08 — Testing program merged (#366–#368, #370, #371); Hosting deploy of #371

Five stacked PRs from the test review, merged in order once each `CI OK` was green:
- **#366** CI tiers follow the diff: an engine or JNI change runs the emulator and
  arm64 tiers on its PR, keep-rule and build-script changes run R8, Tier 1 compiles
  androidTest and `:benchmark`, `main` pushes are path-aware, and a weekly
  `schedule` runs the full matrix. Tier 1 uploads JUnit and Kover reports.
- **#367** Real coverage floors (measured − 2, raised by every test PR): Kover lines
  and branches, the backend with the Firestore emulator tier appended, and the
  console modules.
- **#368** Committed golden `.dat` and GIF files (`-PupdateGoldens` to regenerate);
  `DicFieldIo` tests; the batch loop runs on the emulator.
- **#370** Settings, viewer, restore and admin tests; Kover counts Activities,
  Adapters and Dialogs; device tests wait on conditions, not sleeps.
- **#371** Shared `contracts/` wire bodies (app and backend), the composite-index
  check, `check_console.py`'s own tests, backend thin spots (`drive.py` 65 → 99 %).
  Two fixes: `console/roster.js` took the roster path after Remove / Withdraw was
  confirmed, so a confirmation answered after opening another licence's roster went
  to that licence; and `ShareExportJobs.start` lost the Cancelled outcome of an
  export cancelled before its first dispatch (a 10 s CI timeout).

Floors after #371: app lines 72 / branches 54 (74.50 / 56.41 %, Activities now
counted), backend 93 (95.47 %; 95.54 % with the emulator tier), console lines 53
(55.32 %, counted per page load: TD-203). TD-199–TD-204 hold the gaps left open.

#371 (`f0a5e367`) was deployed with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` and the live check
passed: the live `console/roster.js` takes the path before asking, and
`/finishReset/` loads `/finishReset/reset.js` (200) with no inline script.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploys: every wait explained, and the dashboards on every screen size (#369, #372)

#369 (`676762b2`, merged at 16:09 IST) and #372 (`04c74669`, 16:18 IST) were each
deployed with `scripts/deploy-console.sh`, and both live checks passed. What #369
changed:
- **No signed-out flash.** Every page starts `<body data-auth="pending">` with
  "Checking your sign-in…", and Sign in stays hidden until `auth.js` knows (a CSS
  fallback shows it after 8 s if the scripts never run). The operator desk and
  institution seats keep `#app` hidden until the role or licence check passes.
- **Each wait is named** on the status line, a polite live region: "Checking your
  access…", "Loading licences…", "Loading the roster…", "Loading your analyses…".
  After 4 s it adds "Still working — the server can take a few seconds to start."
- **Tables show placeholder rows while they load**, and a failed load says so in the
  table with a Retry that reruns only that load. A list's buttons are disabled while
  it loads, and a late answer for an earlier request is dropped.
- **The operator desk** puts the licence table first, opens Issue a licence as a card
  from its toolbar, and keeps Edit on each row with the rest under a More menu
  (Revoke and Delete last).
- **Screen sizes:** on phones every table becomes a stack of cards and the header keeps
  to two rows; on tablets tables scroll inside their card with the first column
  pinned; on touch screens every control is at least 44 px; keyboard focus is always
  outlined.
- `scripts/check_console.py` check 10 requires the pending body and the live
  `#status` on every page. The console tests: 214.

The live check of #369 on a phone found the account and institution headers on three
rows, not two: the page title wrapped under the brand. #372 is CSS only: under 600 px
the brand shows just its mark, the title gets room to wrap on itself, and the card
heading rule skips full-width rows.

Measured from the browser pane, signed in as `damodar@indicvision.com`:
- Five warm loads of the operator desk after #369: median 1372 ms to the licences on
  screen, within the 1078–1454 ms range measured after #365.
- The live sequence was "Checking your sign-in…", then "Checking your access…", then
  placeholder rows under "Loading licences…", then the licences, with no Sign in
  button shown on the way.
- A first load after the API had idled: `/v1/me` took 15.2 s, the wait the
  "Still working" line (shown after 4 s) is there to explain.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploy: each dashboard's code in one wave, its data read together (#365)

#365 (`25aed416`) was deployed with `scripts/deploy-console.sh`, and its live check
passed. #362 and #364 were already live (the entry below), so every typed key,
password and confirmation was by then asked for in the page. What #365 changed:
- Every page preloads its whole module graph and `init.json`, and preconnects to
  sign-in and the API.
- The QR library loads only for enrolment.
- The operator desk sends its licence list, approvals and switch list together with
  `/v1/me` instead of after it.

Measured from the browser pane, signed in as `damodar@indicvision.com`, five warm loads
of the operator desk before and after, timed to the licences on screen:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Median | 1689 ms | 1303 ms |
| Range | 1591–2040 ms | 1078–1454 ms |
| `init.json` arrives | about 700 ms | 120–380 ms |
| Licence list starts | about 300 ms after `/v1/me` | with `/v1/me` |

No file was fetched twice, `qrcode` was not loaded, and `/login` still forwards. The
first load after a long idle took 10.7 s, all of it `/v1/me` waiting for the API to
start. That is the wait the dashboards' "Still working — the server can take a few
seconds to start." line (next change) explains.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploy: no browser confirm or alert left in the consoles (#364)

From `0aff4722`, merged at 13:52 IST, with `scripts/deploy-console.sh`. Its live check
found the gateway filled in on `app.sempermechanics.com`. #362, deployed before this,
had moved the typed keys and the revoke password off `window.prompt`. #364 moved the
nine `confirm()` calls and the one `alert()` left into the page as well:
- revoke and delete, both the who-is-affected step and the step after the return from
  Google;
- New device and device history (one move a line);
- the roster's Remove and Withdraw;
- the account page's give-a-seat-back and move-a-device.

All of them are built by one `pageCard` in `auth.js`, as `askInPage`, `confirmInPage`
and `tellInPage`. On both hosts, `auth.js`, `roster.js`, `console.css`,
`operator/lifecycle.js`, `operator/people.js` and `account/account.js` matched `main`,
and `config.js` and the console CSP named the production gateway. Nobody clicked
through the new cards signed in at the time; the console tests (188) drive each one.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploys: the authenticator code asked for in the page, with Try again (#358, #361)

The consoles asked for the authenticator code with `window.prompt`. The Claude desktop
app's browser pane shows no prompt ("Sign-in failed: prompt() is not supported."), so
sign-in could not be completed there. #358 (`51fbfc1d`) moved the code into a card under
the status line. #361 (`dabb23f0`) kept that card open after a wrong code, with **Try
again** taking the next code against the same challenge, with no second trip to Google.
A challenge that times out now says to sign in again. Both were deployed with
`scripts/deploy-console.sh`, and its live check passed each time; these were its first
two real runs. Checked from the pane as `damodar@indicvision.com`. On #358 alone, the code
was rejected (`auth/invalid-verification-code`) and the sign-in ended. On #361, sign-in
completed: `/login` forwarded to Operator, with **2FA on** and the **Operator | Your
account** switch. The desk's typed-key confirmations and the revoke password still used
`window.prompt` at this point. The next change moves them into the page; it is not yet
deployed at the time of writing.

## 2026-10-08 — Deploys now check the live site (`check_live_console.py`)

`scripts/deploy-console.sh` ends by running the new `scripts/check_live_console.py`. It
reads the live `/console/config.js` and the Content-Security-Policy on `/login`,
`/account` and `/console/`, and fails the run if `__API_BASE_URL__` or `__API_ORIGIN__`
is left, or if the gateway is not the one deployed. It also runs on its own, after any
Hosting deploy: `python scripts/check_live_console.py --api <gateway>`. CLAUDE.md and the
console README say so. This is the guard the 2026-10-07 deploy below lacked.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploy: a dashboard switch for every account with more than one role (#353)

#353 merged as `070eb330` and was deployed from it with `scripts/deploy-console.sh`. Live
`/console/roles.js` reports `Last-Modified: Thu, 08 Oct 2026 04:42:06 GMT`. Every console
page now shows one tab per dashboard the account can open, whenever there is more than
one: Operator for `role=admin`, Institution seats for an address an institution licence
names (deep-linked when there is one), and Your account for everyone. The Institution
seats page carries the switch too. `roles.js` holds the decision, and `/login` shares it.
#349's narrower rule (staff with a held licence only) is gone. Checked signed in as
`damodar@indicvision.com` (`role=admin`, Demo key): `/login` forwarded to Operator, the
header showed **Operator | Your account**, and the account page showed it back. Still
owed: a signed-in check as an institution IT contact, and as an account with only Your
account (no switch).

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting redeploy: the console's gateway placeholders (fix for 2026-10-07)

From `4748f653`, with `scripts/deploy-console.sh`. Before it, live `/console/config.js`
held `API_BASE_URL = "__API_BASE_URL__"` and the console CSP held `connect-src 'self'
__API_ORIGIN__ …`. Every console API call failed while that was live. The cause was #346's
bare `firebase deploy --only hosting` (below): every Hosting deploy replaces the whole site,
so it also shipped the committed placeholders. After the redeploy, `config.js` and the CSP
on `/login`, `/account` and `/console/` named the gateway, and `assetlinks.json` matched
`main`. This deploy also put #349 live (the entry below).

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploy: the operator switch mounts after the role check (#352)

From `e663839f`, with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` (the live gateway origin substituted
into `config.js` and the console CSP, placeholders restored afterwards). `operator.js`
now mounts the Operator | Your account switch from the sign-in callback, after
`operatorMe` returns the `/v1/me` answer, instead of inside the role check; nothing a
user sees changed. Both hosts served the new `operator.js`, the production gateway in
`config.js` and in `connect-src`, and `assetlinks.json` right after the deploy.

## 2026-10-08 — Hosting deploy: Operator | Your account switch in the console (#349)

#349 merged at 04:05 UTC (`ae94fc6f`). By the time this entry was written that day, the
live `/console/switcher.js` matched `main` byte for byte, and `/console/account/` carried
the `#switch` nav. The deploy's time, and who ran it, were not recorded. Staff
(`role=admin`) who also hold a licence of their own (`held`, not a Demo key) now get an
**Operator | Your account** switch in the header of the operator desk and the account
page; every other account sees no change. A sign-in check as such an account was still
owed at the time of writing.
[Note 2026-10-08: it went live with the placeholder redeploy from `4748f653` above.
#353 has since widened it to every account with more than one role.]

## 2026-10-07 — Hosting deploy: Material Testing's debug key in `assetlinks.json` (#346)

From `2c1ecef8`, with `firebase deploy --only hosting` in `firebase-hosting/` (one file
uploaded). `com.sempermechanics.materialtesting` now lists the shared debug key
(`39:30:C4…`) beside its release key (`F5:DC…`), as Semper does, so its debug and
benchmark builds can verify App Links. Both hosts served it right after the deploy.
Google's Digital Asset Links API still answered "not linked" for an hour from its cache,
so the Pixel 6 re-verify of the new Material Testing app is still owed.
[Note 2026-10-08: being a bare `firebase deploy`, this also shipped the console with
`__API_BASE_URL__` / `__API_ORIGIN__` unfilled. See the placeholder redeploy above.]

## 2026-10-07 — Backend, gateway and console deploy: the restructuring (#344)

From `85650da`, by hand: `deploy-backend.yml` run 37572831085 sat with no runner
assigned and was cancelled. That is the same runner shortage that cancelled #344's own
secret-scan and legal-pages jobs twice. The steps mirrored the workflow, in order:
1. The `files (uid, sessionId)` index, with `scripts/deploy-firestore.sh indexes`. It
   had to show READY first, because staging and production share the Firestore.
2. Staging: `semper-api-staging` was deployed as a no-traffic `cand` tag, smoked on
   `/readyz`, then promoted. `semper-gw-staging` was switched to a new `v…-manual`
   config rendered from `backend/gateway/openapi.yaml`.
3. Production: the same for `semper-api` and `semper-gw`.
4. The consoles, with `scripts/deploy-console.sh`.

The operator reported the deploy complete. The revision and config names were not
recorded. What the hand deploy skipped:
- The env vars are not re-applied from the GitHub variables: a new revision inherits
  the live service's.
- The serving and rollback images were not re-pinned
  ([BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md](../backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md) §A7).

What changed for callers (#344):
- **Errors:** every refusal comes from one table, with the same codes and statuses as
  before ([ADR-020](../adr/ADR-020-backend-refusal-model.md); TD-185 keeps two
  route-specific statuses).
- **Staff roster routes:** Semper staff have their own under
  `/v1/admin/licenses/{id}/seats` and `…/invites/{key}`. The seat listing on both
  tiers is paged with `page_size` and `page_token`.
- **Request size:** a body over 4 MiB answers `413 request_too_large`.
- **Account export:** `GET /v1/me/export` reads the account's files as one stream
  (TD-195).
- **Consoles:** they read refusal codes rather than messages. The operator desk's
  roster works for staff (TD-191), and the institution page offers its licences as a
  picker.

## 2026-10-05 — Backend deploy: the new app ids (#333)

Staging (`semper-api-staging`, run 37277292633) and production (`semper-api`, run
37277643509) from `67d2ad35` through `deploy-backend.yml`, gateway `dry-run`: the
rendered spec matched the live config, so no gateway change. Production's
candidate passed the `/readyz` smoke and was promoted to 100 %; the serving and
rollback images were re-pinned. What changed for callers: `backend/app/apps.py`
accepts `com.sempermechanics.semper` and `com.sempermechanics.materialtesting`
as the same `semper` / `materialtesting` slots as the old ids (device binding,
ADR-010; backups, ADR-014), and the loggers are `semper.*` instead of
`indic.*` (no log-based metric or alert in the repo filters on the name).

## 2026-10-05 — Hosting deploy: App Links for the new app ids (#333)

Hosting only, from `67d2ad35` (`main` after #333/#334) with
`scripts/deploy-console.sh` against `semper-gw`. One file changed:
`/.well-known/assetlinks.json` now lists `com.sempermechanics.semper` and
`com.sempermechanics.materialtesting` beside the old ids
([ADR-019](../adr/ADR-019-sempermechanics-app-id.md)); every console file already
matched `main` before the deploy. The backend followed the same day (entry
above). The Firebase Android app
`1:171818100029:android:db984f1bba569a38161154` (same debug and release
fingerprints as the old app) and its App Check (Play Integrity) were registered
the same day.

## 2026-10-01 — Backend and console deploy: cloud sessions tagged by app (#303)

From `9230f444`. Staging first: `deploy-backend.yml` run 36843745324 →
`semper-api-staging-36843745324-1` (digest `sha256:6db01fb7…`), with
`semper-gw-staging` going from `v202610010422-79` to `v202610010939-82`. Then
production: run 36844645753 → image `semper-api-36844645753-1`
(`sha256:d50fc134…`), with `semper-gw` going from `v202610010433-80` to
`v202610010948-83`. The previous production image (`semper-api-36819391914-1`,
`sha256:ec30cc86…`) is pinned as `rollback-prev`.

- Both runs used `gateway_mode: apply`. `/readyz` returned `firestore: ok,
  drive: ok` on each candidate before the promote. Each gateway's outside check
  answered 401 on `GET /v1/config` and 200 on the preflight. Both gateway diffs
  were #303's documentation-level additions alone: the `app` query parameter
  and 400 on `GET /v1/sessions`, and the 404 on the restore manifest.
- #303 ([ADR-014](../adr/ADR-014-session-app-tag.md)): a new session is tagged
  with the app named by `X-App-Id` (no header = `semper`). `GET /v1/sessions`
  lists the asking app's sessions (`?app=all` for the whole account), and
  `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/files` answers only that app. The analyses quota stays
  account-wide.
- Backfill before the deploy (`backend/scripts/tag_session_apps.py`, run by
  hand from #303's branch): 75 sessions tagged, 68 `semper` and 7
  `materialtesting`. The dry run after the production promote found 0 left to
  tag.
- The console went out first, with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` to
  `indicvision-dic-app-auth` from `9230f444`: the account page asks for
  `/v1/sessions?app=all` and shows an App column.
- Merged the same day, not part of the backend image: #297 (CI path filter,
  CI APK versionCode 1 and releases at 1000 + run number, deploy and Firestore
  workflows upstream-only, [FORK_SYNC.md](FORK_SYNC.md)), #298, #299, #300,
  #301, #302 (app fixes and features ported from material_testing, for the next
  app release) and #304 (benchmark phone-state gates, ADR-008).

## 2026-10-01 — Backend deploy: Dependabot dependency bumps (#289, #290)

From `615149fd`, production only (staging skipped on request): `deploy-backend.yml`
run 36819391914 → image `semper-api-36819391914-1` (digest `sha256:ec30cc86…`).
The previous image (`semper-api-36815427585-1`, `sha256:238b43b4…`) is pinned as
`rollback-prev`. `/readyz` on the candidate returned `firestore: ok, drive: ok`
before the promote. `gateway_mode: dry-run`: `semper-gw` stays on
`v202610010433-80`, which already serves the spec. Staging still runs `9b12b14b`.

- #290: uvicorn[standard] 0.53.0 → 0.54.0, google-auth 2.58.0 → 2.58.1,
  google-cloud-firestore 2.31.0 → 2.32.0, google-cloud-tasks 2.24.0 → 2.25.0,
  firebase-admin 7.6.0 → 7.7.0; ruff 0.16.8 → 0.16.9 (tests only). The lock was
  regenerated by the Backend lock workflow (run 36816673230).
- #289: `python:3.12-slim` base image re-pinned to digest `f77ac9e`.
- Merged the same day, not part of the backend image: #291 (Gradle 9.8.0,
  WorkManager 2.12.0, core-ktx, transition, Spotless) and #292 (`setup-gradle`
  action 6.4.0). `main` CI passed every tier for both, including the emulator
  and the signed release.

## 2026-10-01 — Backend deploy: replace a backup's metadata.json (#288)

From `9b12b14b`. Staging first: `deploy-backend.yml` run 36814500108 →
`semper-api-staging-36814500108-1`, with `semper-gw-staging` going from
`v202609261024-71` to `v202610010422-79`. Then production: run 36815427585 →
image `semper-api-36815427585-1`, with `semper-gw` going from `v202609261112-75`
to `v202610010433-80`. The previous production image is pinned as `rollback-prev`.

- Both runs used `gateway_mode: apply`. `/readyz` passed on each candidate
  before the promote. Each gateway's outside check answered 401 on
  `GET /v1/config` and 200 on the preflight.
- Production's gateway diff was the new route alone.
- Staging's diff also dropped the four `/v1/campus/*` alias paths and the
  "campus is accepted" note. Production lost those on 2026-09-26; staging's
  gateway had not been switched since.

- #288: `PUT /v1/sessions/{sid}/metadata` (device-signed) writes the app's
  current metadata.json over a COMPLETED session's Drive object and updates the
  file doc's size and checksums ([ADR-013](../adr/ADR-013-session-metadata-replace.md)).
  It is Material Testing's TD-150 fix: a bending deflection correction set after
  the backup now reaches the cloud copy, and so a restore. The app side is
  material_testing#112, which ships with that app's next release. Its builds
  until then never call the route. Semper's app does not call it.


Staging first (`deploy-backend.yml` run 36669887146 → `semper-api-staging-36669887146-1`),
then production run 36670760641 → image `semper-api-36670760641-1`, both from
`31a33e79`; the previous production image is pinned as `rollback-prev`. The
gateway ran as dry-run on both: no route changed. `/readyz` passed on each
candidate before the promote, and neither service sets `MAX_FRAMES_PER_ANALYSIS`
in its env, so the new default is what `/config` serves.

- #286: `MAX_FRAMES_PER_ANALYSIS` default 150 → 500, for Semper and Material
  Testing alike. Both apps already allowed 500 on their own
  (`DicSettings.MAX_MAX_FRAMES`, the slider's `valueTo`); the backend default was
  the only 150. `MAX_FILES_PER_SESSION` stays 600: uploads since 2026-08-12 are
  three objects whatever the frame count. A build older than that still uploads
  per file (3F+4) and gets a 413 past ~198 frames. Same change as
  material_testing#104.

## 2026-09-28 — Backend deploy: one phone per app (#279, #280)

Production `semper-api` from `ed0adbc` (`deploy-backend.yml` run 36419849032,
image `semper-api-36419849032-1`; the previous revision `semper-api-00029-z72`
is pinned as `rollback-prev`). The gateway ran as dry-run: its spec did not
change. `/readyz` passed on the candidate before the promote.

- #279 (TD-137): a device-lock mismatch is Demo for that request only; it is
  no longer stored on the account.
- #280 (TD-138, [ADR-010](../adr/ADR-010-device-binding-per-app.md)): each app
  names itself with `X-App-Id` and has its own registered device, release hold,
  lock and cooldown. A request without the header is Semper, so builds in the
  field are unchanged.

The console half of #280 went out the same day (`scripts/deploy-console.sh`
from `0c3946f7`): seats and the pending-users list show each app's device, and
the account page offers "Use Material Testing on a different device".
material_testing#90 brought the header to Material Testing; a debug build of it
signed in on a Pixel 6 (Semper not installed there). It read as licensed once
the account's stored `mode: demo`, left by the old mismatch bug, was set back
by hand: #279 stops new demotions but does not undo old ones.

## 2026-09-26 — App release `v1.2-beta.3`

Release run 36239577288 on `main` at `ae05bb87` (CI green on that commit,
emulator E2E included): signed APK, versionCode 35, private GitHub pre-release
`v1.2-beta.3`, R8 mapping uploaded to Crashlytics. It carries every app change
merged since `v1.2-beta.2` (28 PRs that touch `app/`). Pixel 6 smoke the same day
on the account #264 demoted, which runs as Demo:
- Clean install and sign-in.
- A two-frame run: 79.3 % converged, and frame names follow the picked files.
- Attested upload: `POST /v1/sessions`, then `…/uploads` and three `complete` calls, all 200.
- Home read "9 / 25" after a refresh.
- No crashes.

Share, PDF, Delete everywhere, Restore and the backups card need a licensed account
and were not smoked. The Current state entries this release closes, as they stood:

- **App release `v1.2-beta.2`** (beta, private GitHub Release, from `fab33cb`): the
  burn-down's app half, #180's strain window in data points, engine `v0.2.2`, #182 (TD-66).
- **Merged, awaiting release:** #189, four fixes ported from material_testing
  (`SubsetRecommender` reads speckle inside the ROI from textured patches only,
  `VsgPlotView` y gutter, `TouchImageView` zoom across a resize, `AviReader` µs slack);
  #197, `settingsScroll` skips the licence-only settings headers and
  `scripts/ci_test_report.py` puts failing device tests and benchmark numbers in the CI log;
  #203 (TD-81), Compute comes back after a single run fails outright, and a first frame
  that kept no points says why (the strain window with the run's VSG and step, nothing
  correlated, or an unreadable frame).
- **Measured optimisation (2026-09-25, all six passes done).** Passes 1–2 (#191, #206) take
  an app open from 12 to 3 requests on the Pixel 6 and ship with the next app build; Pass 4
  (#202) is deployed; Passes 3, 5 and 6 measured nothing worth changing
  ([perf/request-volume.md](../perf/request-volume.md), [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)).
- **Benchmarks in CI.** `HotPathMicroBenchmark` runs (#200, TD-86: debug-only permission,
  `am instrument`); the scrub seeder writes the ranges sidecar (#208, TD-87: 150-frame heap
  161 → 21 MB); #214 reuses one frame buffer, #217 (TD-88) saves the sidecar after a full
  decode. #229/#230 (TD-90): no API URL now reads as offline instead of crashing on open.
- **Wrong-information audit, app half (merged, awaiting release):** #211 (enforce a known
  licensed ceiling), #212 (PDF page cover image and name, mixed bulk-delete prompt, sweep
  export header, per-node sweep reasons, restored skip count), #218 (licence countdown, backup
  status, local quota count, restored stop reasons), #219 (PDF and share extremes), #220 (run
  counts, stale Home rows), #223 (counts, captions, report names, progress), #225 (frame names
  past a skipped frame, Home headline, partial-run dialog). No audit TECH_DEBT rows remain.
- **Bulk delete.** Backend half deployed (#226, [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)); app half
  merged, awaiting release (#227: one `SessionDeletes` queue, Delete everywhere, cloud link cleared).
  Pixel 6, 10 rows, Delete everywhere: 10 DELETEs, all 200, in ~17 s (was 61 in 100 s).
  **Restore (#234, merged, awaiting release):** Home says Restore, restores a multi-selection,
  shares `RestoreStart` with Settings, and announces a failed restore once (`RestoreFailureLedger`).
  Pixel 6, 3 at once: 13 requests, 0 × 429, ~17 s, so restores stay parallel. **Home cloud
  backups (#235, merged, awaiting release):** a card offers backups this phone has no row for (`CloudBackupListing`).
- **"Upload pending" with no upload coming (#254, merged, awaiting release):** a build with no
  backend saves analyses as not backed up, and each reconcile queues rows still PENDING again.
  Pixel 6, 2026-09-26: its 8 waiting analyses backed up on their own after sign-in.
- **`v1.2-beta.2` shows "1 / 1 analyses used"** after a user's first analysis, whatever
  the cap: its plural's "one" form is a hard-coded "1 / 1", so a licensed account (cap 999)
  looks capped at 1. TD-82's fix (`b9c218da`) is on `main`, so the next release carries it.
  The backend floor for a licensed cap (#211) is deployed; the app half ships with that release.

## 2026-09-26 — Backend, gateway and console deploy: compat shims 1–5 retired (#267), account status line (#271)

Staging first (run 36237349656 → `semper-api-staging-36237349656-1`, staging
gateway updated in the same run), then production run 36237598434 (gateway
`dry-run`) and run 36237900008 (`apply`) from `10809473`. The dry-run diff was the
four `/v1/campus/*` alias paths and the "campus is accepted" note removed (76
lines) plus one description line. `apply` switched `semper-gw` from
`v202609261040-72` to `v202609261112-75`; its outside check answered 401 on
`GET /v1/config` and 200 on the preflight, and the live gateway now answers 404
on `/v1/campus/licenses/x/seats` and 401 on `/v1/institutions/licenses/x/seats`.
`REQUIRE_ATTESTED_UPLOADS` was then removed from both services by hand
(`gcloud run services update … --remove-env-vars`), giving `semper-api-00029-z72`
and `semper-api-staging-00028-ndp`; the GitHub variable stays until no pre-#267
commit can be redeployed. The console went out with `scripts/deploy-console.sh`.

- #267 (TD-45, shims 1–5 of CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP §20.5): `PRO_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER`
  is no longer read; `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/uploads` always requires an attested
  device; admin mint refuses `kind="campus"` and the user-config patch refuses
  `plan` (422); the `/v1/campus/*` seat aliases are gone from FastAPI and the
  gateway. Evidence, checked live before the change: neither service carried the
  old variable; 30 days of logs (back to 2026-09-07, old `indic-api` included)
  had no `legacy_unattested_uploads`, 73 `/uploads` reads with none refused, no
  `/v1/campus` request and no user-config PATCH. Shims 6–9 wait on the app fleet.
- #268 and #270 (TD-22): 156 behavioural tests for `auth.js`, `router.js` and the
  operator, account and institution pages, run by `node --test` against a fake
  Firebase and a parsed DOM; no deploy needed.
- #271 (TD-136, found by #270): the account page keeps "Could not read your
  account" when the analyses answer second instead of clearing it.

## 2026-09-26 — Backend, gateway and console deploy: Demo phone change through staff (#266, with #264)

From `f95dc558`, run by hand, staging then production, both with `gateway_mode: apply`
because #266 adds a route. Staging run 36235540338 → `semper-api-staging-36235540338-1`,
`semper-gw-staging` on `v202609261024-71`; production run 36236313898 →
`semper-api-36236313898-1`, `semper-gw` on `v202609261040-72`. The candidate `/readyz`
smoke passed on both. Each gateway diff added only `/v1/admin/device-releases`. From
outside with no token, that route answers 401 on both gateways. The console went out
afterwards with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` against `semper-gw`.

- #266 closes TD-126, on the decision that a Demo account may change phone like any other
  account, on request to operators, never self-service. `POST /v1/admin/device-releases`
  `{"email": …}` (`ADMIN_STEPUP`) makes the release a lock clear makes: the old device
  `SUPERSEDED`, its id held off for `DEVICE_RELEASE_HOLD_HOURS`, audited as
  `ADMIN_DEVICE_RELEASE`. An account on a live licence is `409
  license_device_clear_required`; **New device** moves both bindings. The operator console
  has a **Release a Demo account's phone** card, by email.
- #264 (only the registered phone takes the device lock) was on staging since run
  36233420945 and reached production with this deploy.
- Both runs moved `serving` and `rollback-prev` by digest, the first moves since
  `indic-deployer` got `roles/artifactregistry.repoAdmin` on the repository: production's
  `rollback-prev` is #261/#263's image (`7e8fcd0c…`).

## 2026-09-26 — Console deploy: licence edit fixes (#257); staging gateway in CI (#258)

#257, hosting only, from `2db99e8c` with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` against `semper-gw`;
the live release is 2026-09-26 07:41 UTC.

- The Edit dialog refuses a new end that has already passed (`licenceEditPatch`, the
  backend's `expiry_in_past` rule) before asking for the typed key; it used to ask first
  and then show the server's 422.
- Opening Edit clears the page status line, where a "… saved" from the last action read
  as this edit's result beside the dialog's error.

#258: `deploy-backend.yml`'s `gateway` job runs for staging too (`semper-gw-staging` on API
`semper-api-staging`; [ADR-006](../adr/ADR-006-gateway-deploy-job.md) amendment). The
first run, staging run 36227641846 from `cd7d5db6` with `gateway_mode: dry-run`, deployed
`semper-api-staging-36227641846-1`, read the live config `v202609260428` and found it
already serves the spec, so the gateway was not touched.

#256 (docs) went in alongside: ADR-007's TTL item, and the licence scripts' usage lines
name `--project indicvision-dic-app`.

## 2026-09-26 — Backend and console deploy: device-clear follow-ups, pinned images (#261, #263)

Both from `0f9244f1`, staging then production with the gateway dry-run. Staging run
36232810308 → `semper-api-staging-36232810308-1`; production run 36233033808 →
`semper-api-36233033808-1`. The candidate `/readyz` smoke passed on both, and both
dry-runs found the live config already serving the spec (`v202609260428` on staging,
`v202609260522-60` on production). The console went out afterwards with
`scripts/deploy-console.sh` against `semper-gw`; the live `operator.js` has the new
device-history line.

- #261 closes TD-128 to TD-132. A device-lock clear reads the holder once and writes the
  mode, the release and `updatedAt` in one batch (`_settle_holder`), and its audit detail
  names `releasedDeviceId` (the registered phone signed out) beside `previousDeviceId`
  (the lock's). The console's device history prints `signed out <id>` when they differ.
  One `_retire_device` helper replaces three copies.
- #263 closes TD-122 to TD-125. After the promote, `deploy-backend.yml` tags `serving` on
  the promoted image and `rollback-prev` on the one it replaced, and `keep-serving` also
  keeps `serving`. The updated cleanup policy was applied by hand beforehand
  (`--no-dry-run`, still enforcing).
- Production's run created both tags. Staging's failed: its hand-made `rollback-prev`
  already existed, and moving a tag needs `artifactregistry.tags.delete`, which
  `roles/artifactregistry.writer` lacks. `indic-deployer` now holds
  `roles/artifactregistry.repoAdmin` on `cloud-run-source-deploy` only, and staging's
  two tags were set by hand (`serving` → `099591f3…`, `rollback-prev` → `3ca0200a…`).
- `semper-api:rollback-c0c0ce3` is deleted: `rollback-prev` (#255's image, `19d8dfed…`)
  replaces it, and `c0c0ce3` predated ADR-007.

## 2026-09-26 — Backend deploy: a lock clear frees the phone only where the mode is restored (#255)

Backend only, staging then production with the gateway dry-run. Staging run 36226047617
from `f04be71a` → `semper-api-staging-36226047617-1`; production run 36227358113 from
`cd7d5db6` → `semper-api-36227358113-1` (#256 to #258 on top change no `backend/app` code).
The candidate `/readyz` smoke passed on both, and the dry-run found that `v202609260522-60`
already serves the spec, so the gateway was not touched.

- Closes TD-127. `_release_holder_device` (#248) checked only that the holder was still on
  the licence, so **New device** on a held or revoked seat, or a revoked licence, freed the
  phone of a holder already on Demo, who could then register a different one. The release
  and `_restore_holder_mode` now share one guard, `_live_holder`: nothing is released or
  restored for a revoked licence, a seat that is not `active`, or an account that moved to
  another licence. IT resumes a held seat before **New device** if the member is moving.

## 2026-09-26 — Console deploy: delete/revoke step-up fixes (#251)

Hosting only, from `9b06aad8` with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` against `semper-gw`; the
live release is 2026-09-26 06:54 UTC. Found testing the licence desk end to end on a
throwaway licence (issue, duplicate refused, every edit path, delete, restore, delete).

- A delete or revoke that went to Google for re-authentication was dropped silently when
  the return leg failed (a wrong or cancelled authenticator code, or Back out of Google):
  `requireSignIn` handed back no `resume`, and the desk's list load cleared the error. The
  stash now comes back marked `reauthFailed` and the desk says the action was not sent.
  The operator's retry skips the 120 s redirect-loop guard.
- `stepUpForRevoke` asked every account for a password first; a Google-only operator who
  typed one got `auth/invalid-credential`. Only an account with a password provider is
  asked now (`reauthMethods`).

## 2026-09-26 — Backend deploys: a device change reaches the new phone (#248, #249)

Two backend-only deploys, both staging then production with the gateway dry-run. #248, from
`5b7d0642`: staging run 36223348648 → `semper-api-staging-36223348648-1`, then production run
36223604531 → `semper-api-36223604531-1`. #249, from `dea4fcc7` (#250 on top is docs only):
staging run 36224232418 → `semper-api-staging-36224232418-1`, then production run
36224429945 → `semper-api-36224429945-1`. The candidate `/readyz` smoke passed on all four
(`firestore` and `drive` ok on #249's). Both dry-runs found that `v202609260522-60` already
serves the spec, so the gateway was not touched. From outside with no token,
`POST /v1/devices/register` answers 401 and an unknown path 404. `DEVICE_RELEASE_HOLD_HOURS`
is not set on the service, so the 24-hour default applies.

- #248: clearing a device lock (staff, institution IT, or the holder's own **Use Semper on a
  different device**) also deletes the holder's `users/{uid}.activeDeviceId` and retires the
  old `devices/{id}` as `SUPERSEDED` (`_release_holder_device`). Before it, registration
  refused every new phone with `409 device_conflict`, so a cleared lock never reached the new
  phone (found 2026-09-26 on an emulator). A demo account has no licence to clear, so it still
  cannot change phone (TD-126).
- #249: the released phone is held off for 24 hours. Every signed call from it reads
  `device_not_active`, and the app's upload worker answers that by re-registering, which took
  the account straight back. The clear stamps `releasedDeviceId` / `releasedAt`, and
  registration refuses that id with `409 device_conflict` until another device registers or
  the hold runs out. Installed builds read that 409 as "bound to a different device". Found
  reviewing #248; its other findings are TD-127 to TD-132.

## 2026-09-26 — Firestore TTL policies declared as field overrides (#242)

`scripts/deploy-firestore.sh indexes` had created the licence desk's composite indexes and
then stopped: the Firebase CLI lists each live TTL policy as a field override, and in
non-interactive mode it will not leave one that the indexes file omits ("Pass the --force
flag"). `--force` would have deleted the three policies on the `(default)` database, which
staging and production share. `backend/firestore.indexes.json` now declares
`challenges.expireAt`, `deleted_licenses.purgeAt` and `deleted_seats.purgeAt` under
`fieldOverrides` with `"ttl": true`. Each one restates the field's live single-field
indexes (ascending, descending, array-contains), because an empty `indexes` list turns
single-field indexing off. `test_firestore_indexes_declare_ttl_policies` checks the three.
The script header notes a Firebase CLI on Node >= 20 (Git Bash, not WSL) and warns off
`--force`. BACKEND_SETUP_CONSOLE.md §3a and §3b, BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md A2b and
CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md §5 were corrected to match the file.

Deployed without `--force` from the PR head (`6a42c879`, whose indexes file and script
match `main`): `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes --non-interactive --debug` exited 0,
skipped all four composite indexes and all three overrides, and sent Firestore no writes.
Afterwards all three policies were still `ACTIVE` and still inherited the default index
config, and all four composite indexes were `READY`.

## 2026-09-26 — Backend and console deploy: scale to zero (#240), licence desk (#236–#239)

Production `semper-api-36220429126-1` from `141ddcae`. Staging went first: run 36219875207 →
`semper-api-staging-36219875207-1`. Production run 36220059465 → `semper-api-36220059465-1`
with the gateway dry-run, then run 36220429126 with `apply`. The candidate `/readyz` smoke
passed on all three. `apply` switched `semper-gw` from `v202609251206-56` to
`v202609260522-60`. The diff added the licence desk's new admin routes and changed
descriptions. From outside with no token, `GET /v1/admin/deleted-licenses`, `POST
…/deleted-licenses/{id}/restore` and `POST …/licenses/{id}/convert` answer 401 and an
unknown path 404. The console went out afterwards with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` to
`indicvision-dic-app-auth` (API base `semper-gw-86wx7pp1.an.gateway.dev`). The hosted
`operator.js`, `operator/index.html`, `util.js`, `auth.js`, `institution.js` and
`console.css` hash-match `main`, and the operator page loads with no console errors.

- #240: Cloud Run scales to zero in both environments. `min instances` is unset on the live
  service, where production had `minScale=1`. `backend/deploy/` holds a 15-day cleanup
  policy for the registry and the run-sources bucket, applied the same day by the owner
  ([BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md A7](../backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md#a7-storage-hygiene)). The
  registry policy is enforcing (dry run off). The serving digests of `semper-api` and
  `semper-api-staging` equal their `latest` tags, so the keep rule covers them. The bucket
  deletes at age 15; the Firestore backup bucket keeps its own 35-day rule. The registry
  held 1.35 GB in 35 versions, the oldest from 2026-09-23, so nothing qualifies before
  about 2026-10-08.
  Measurement: [perf/backend-cost.md](../perf/backend-cost.md).
- The deploy also shipped the licence desk, backend and console ([ADR-007](../adr/ADR-007-licence-lifecycle.md)).
  - #236: a fast, filtered list. It hides Demo keys unless asked and searches by address,
    domain or key prefix.
  - #237: one licence per person. A mint for an address that already holds one is 409
    `email_already_licensed`.
  - #238: edit, upgrade and convert in place.
  - #239: delete into a 30-day hold, with restore.
  - What they need was in place by the deploy: the three `licenses` composite indexes are READY
    and the TTL policies on `deleted_licenses.purgeAt` and `deleted_seats.purgeAt` are ACTIVE
    (checked 2026-09-26).

## 2026-09-25 — Backend and console deploy: no analysis cap on a demo key (#232)

Production `semper-api-36132773366-1` from `eb18ef8` (staging first, run
36132056688 → `semper-api-staging-36132056688-1`; production run 36132401032 →
`semper-api-36132401032-1` with the gateway dry-run, then run 36132773366 with
`apply`). Candidate smoke passed on all three. The gateway diff was descriptions
only; `apply` switched `semper-gw` from `v202609250953-51` to `v202609251206-56`,
and the outside check answered 401 on `GET /v1/config` and 200 on the preflight.
The console went out with `scripts/deploy-console.sh` to `indicvision-dic-app-auth`
(only `operator/operator.js` changed).

- #232: `PATCH /v1/admin/licenses/{id}` refuses `maxAnalyses` on a demo-mode key
  with `422 cap_on_demo_key`. A demo holder gets `DEMO_MAX_ANALYSES` whatever the
  key stores, so the edit had answered 200 and changed nothing. `clearMaxAnalyses`
  is still accepted. `GET /v1/admin/licenses` returns `demoMaxAnalyses`; the
  operator desk shows "demo (25)" on demo rows and disables their Cap button.
- The case that found it: the system demo key SEMP-8AKN was given a cap of 100 at
  11:17 UTC and its holder still saw "of 25". The stored cap was cleared from the
  desk at 11:53 UTC (audited `clearMaxAnalyses`), before the new console shipped.

## 2026-09-25 — Measured optimisation, all six passes

Request volume ([perf/request-volume.md](../perf/request-volume.md)):
- Pass 1 (#191) runs `CloudSync.reconcile` one call at a time.
- Pass 2 (#206) shares the launch `/v1/config` fetch.
- Together: 12 → 3 requests per app open on the Pixel 6. Both are merged and
  ship with the next app build.

Pass 4 (#202) is deployed: an inline `POST /v1/sessions` costs 6 + N
Firestore reads instead of 8 + 2N, with no rise in latency (median 2487 ms, n = 10)
(see the 2026-09-25 inline-create deploy below).

Measured, no change:
- Pass 3: one ~1.7 s App Check attestation per cold open, which only the Play
  account can remove.
- Pass 5: no cold-start gain from precompiling ([perf/startup.md](../perf/startup.md)).
- Pass 6: no engine or viewer regression
  ([perf/engine-viewer-check-2026-09.md](../perf/engine-viewer-check-2026-09.md)).

## 2026-09-25 — Backend deploy: a session-delete bucket (#226)

Production `semper-api-36122511953-1` from `cb0e893` (staging first, run
36122073964 → `semper-api-staging-36122073964-1`; production run 36122511953).
Candidate smoke passed on both; the gateway dry-run found the live config
`v202609250953-51` already serves the spec.

- #226: `DELETE /v1/sessions/{sid}` draws on its own `session_erase_bucket`
  (1/s, burst 10) instead of sharing account erasure's (0.2/s, burst 3). Ten
  deletes from Home had taken 61 requests over 100 s, 38 of them 429s. The app
  half (#227: one paced queue, no re-sent deletes) ships with the next app release.

## 2026-09-25 — Backend and console deploy: wrong-information audit (#211, #215, #216, #221, #224)

Production `semper-api-36120337264-1` from `fd14374` (staging first, run
36119768491 → `semper-api-staging-36119768491-1`; production run 36120311362 →
`semper-api-36120311362-1` with the gateway dry-run, then run 36120337264 with
`apply`). Candidate smoke passed on all three. The gateway diff was descriptions
and documented response codes only; `apply` switched `semper-gw` from
`v202609241122-44` to `v202609250953-51`, and the outside check answered 401 on
`GET /v1/config` and 200 on the preflight. The console went out with
`scripts/deploy-console.sh` to `indicvision-dic-app-auth`; `app.sempermechanics.com`
serves it against the production gateway.

- #211: a licensed analysis ceiling is never below demo's; staff can clear a
  licence's per-person cap (`clearMaxAnalyses`); the operator form and table name
  the field "Analyses / person".
- #215: seat and lease counters — no resume on a removed seat, a lease that
  expired unswept is still decremented, whole-licence revoke and account delete
  free their seats and leases, a stranded invite is retried.
- #216: console labels and dates — Mode column, expired/in-grace pills, expiry as
  a UTC date, reconcile reasons instead of "never claimed", `held` on `/v1/me`.
- #221: the lease sweep reclaims each seat in its own transaction; a lost race is
  `503 claim_contended`, not "no seats left"; the quota refusal names an ended
  licence or a missing seat; Extend refuses a past, earlier or perpetual expiry;
  claims mirror the licence terms read inside the transaction.
- #224: the device-change cooldown refusal carries its date (and `Retry-After`);
  `maxSeats` below seats in use is `422 max_seats_below_used`; revoke returns the
  reset counts; invites are not claimed onto a lapsed licence; a provisioning
  retry cannot undo COMPLETED; failed uploads leave the quota and show no size.
  The quota count now costs one more Firestore read on `GET` and `POST
  /v1/sessions` (accepted by the owner over a new composite index;
  [perf/request-volume.md](../perf/request-volume.md)).

The audit's app half (#211's ceiling, #212, #218, #219, #220, #223, #225) ships
with the next app release.

## 2026-09-25 — Backend deploy: inline create reads (#202), deployer IAM (TD-71)

Production `semper-api-36096112375-1` from `300fb7f` (staging first, run
36095277741 → `semper-api-staging-36095277741-1`; production run 36096112375).
Candidate smoke passed on both; the gateway dry-run found the live config
`v202609241122-44` already serves the spec.

- #202: an inline `POST /v1/sessions` answers from the upload targets it opened
  instead of reading the session and file docs back: 8 + 2N → 6 + N Firestore
  reads (N = 3: 14 → 9). `backend/tests/test_read_budget.py` holds each route's
  cost ([perf/request-volume.md](../perf/request-volume.md) Pass 4). Production
  latency after the deploy: median 2487 ms over 10 uploads (was 3158 ms, n = 9), so
  no rise.
- TD-71: every deploy failed after the clean-up with `403 … storage.buckets.list`,
  because a source deploy lists the project's buckets to find `run-sources-*`.
  `indic-deployer` now also holds `roles/storage.bucketViewer` (buckets get/list,
  no object access); both deploys ran on the narrowed roles.

## 2026-09-24 — Deny-all Firestore rules deployed (#185)

#185 (TD-70) replaced Hosting's undeployable `firestore` block with
`scripts/deploy-firestore.sh`; the deny-all `firestore.rules` then went to
`indicvision-dic-app`. Anonymous REST reads and a create answer
`403 PERMISSION_DENIED`; the Auth project has no Firestore database.

## 2026-09-24 — App release v1.2-beta.2 (#182)

`v1.2-beta.2` (beta channel, private GitHub Release) from `fab33cb`, main CI
green through Tier 3 and Tier 5: `v1.2-beta.1` plus #182, which keeps the
upload CSV's `#` field-stats rows above the point section (TD-66).

## 2026-09-24 — Backend deploy, first CI gateway apply (#173, #179, #182, #183)

Production `semper-api-35992296245-1` from `4d5a0ab` (staging first, run
35990629608). It carries #173 (firebase-admin 7.6.0, google-auth 2.58.0,
google-cloud-firestore 2.31.0, uvicorn 0.53.0) and #179 (`python:3.12-slim`
digest `2f17fc0`). After the owner's IAM grant, ADR-006's `gateway` job ran for
the first time: a dry-run failed decoding the live document (`base64: invalid
input`), fixed by #183; the next dry-run's diff was a comment and the removed
`/v1/campus` invite-revoke alias (TD-45); `apply` (run 35992296245) switched
`semper-gw` from `v202609230845` to `v202609241122-44` and passed its
401/preflight checks. TD-27 closed. #182 (TD-66: the upload CSV's stats rows
stay above the point section) merged as `5c4fe19`; app-only, so it ships with
the release after `v1.2-beta.1`.

## 2026-09-24 — App release v1.2-beta.1; strain window in points, engine v0.2.2 (#180)

#180 ported two material_testing changes. The strain window is entered in
data points (odd 3–31, default 5); the engine gets the VSG,
`(window − 1) × step + 1` px, and sessions still store and export the VSG
(material_testing #20). The `native/` submodule moved to engine `v0.2.2`,
which rejects displacement outliers with an iterated 5×5 normalized median
test before the VSG fit (semper-dic-engine#3, material_testing #21: on a
published PMMA bend, 45 px strain RMSE over all frames 915 / 3874 / 2117 →
412 / 394 / 392 µε). Merged as `2214860`; main CI green through Tier 3 and
Tier 5. Released as `v1.2-beta.1` (beta channel, private GitHub Release,
Release run 35987799464), which also ships the #155–#168 burn-down's app
half and everything app-side since `v1.2-beta.0`. No backend change.

## 2026-09-24 — Tech-debt burn-down (#155–#168)

Fourteen stacked PRs from the verified register in
[TECH_DEBT.md](TECH_DEBT.md), with [ADR-001..006](../adr/README.md). Merged
2026-09-24 05:40Z; main CI green through Tier 3 and Tier 5. The backend half
(`app/repo/` package behind the `firestore_repo` facade, route-aware access
log, `rate_limit.enforce`, bounded outbound `Retry-After`) went to staging in
Deploy Backend run 35963140403 and to production in run 35963412251, revision
`semper-api-35963412251-1` from `11eddc5` (with #171); `readyz ok`, 100 %
traffic. The app half (`RunSpec`, `ViewerArgs`, wizard draft, `CloudApi` seam,
checked PDF write) waits for the next release. The same production run was
ADR-006's first `gateway` run, `dry-run`: it stopped at the diff step with
`apigateway.apis.get` denied, before the owner's IAM grant. The live gateway
config therefore still routes the removed campus invite-revoke alias (TD-45),
which the backend now 404s; nothing calls it.

## 2026-09-24 — Terms 16+ (#169), reverted to 18+ (#171)

**Terms: age 16+, then back to 18+ (owner decisions, 2026-09-24).** #169
changed Terms §1.3 to admit users from 16, with a parent or legal guardian
agreeing for anyone under 18 (Privacy §8 to match), and moved `TERMS_VERSION`
to `2026-09-24`. It was deployed to staging and production (revision
`semper-api-35959026266-1`) and to Hosting. The owner then asked for 18+
again: #171 restores the legal documents, hosted pages, `backend/app/legal.py`
and `LegalTerms.kt` to version `2026-09-15` byte for byte, so users who
accepted `2026-09-15` stay accepted and only those who accepted `2026-09-24`
while it was live are asked again. Ported from, and reverted with,
material_testing #12 and #15.

## 2026-09-24 — A 429 no longer spends the nonce (#154)

**A 429 no longer spends the nonce (#154, live 2026-09-24).**
Erasing seven analyses from a Pixel 6 left two in the cloud: past the erase
bucket's burst of three, each delete got a 429, and the app's unchanged retry
came back 401 `nonce_invalid_or_replayed`, because the bucket was checked in
the handler after `verified_device` had claimed the nonce. The 401 also made
the app drop client nonces for the rest of its process, so from then on the
retry replayed a consumed server challenge and nothing recovered. The 21
signed routes now take their bucket as `dependencies=[rate_limited(...)]`,
resolved before the nonce is touched, and their 429s send `Retry-After`. No app
change; installed builds are fixed by the deploy. Nothing was lost: a failed
cloud erase keeps the local copy. Production revision `semper-api-35957034833-1`
(from `2fdb44c`) has served since 04:48Z; the same phone then erased four at
once, the fourth got a 429, waited 2 s and its unchanged resend returned 200,
with no 401 — the two left over are gone from the cloud too.

## 2026-09-23 — Starved device-lock binds (`fix/deflake-device-lock-test`)

**A starved device-lock bind is not a loss (`fix/deflake-device-lock-test`).**
The emulator test `test_the_first_device_wins_an_unbound_lock` flaked (2 in 10
locally, and on PR #148) with **zero** winners: all eight binds exhausted their
transaction retries and `bind_device_lock` read that as "another device won",
returning False with the lock still empty — which `_activate_individual` then
answered as `license_device_mismatch`. A starved round now re-reads the lock
and binds again (three jittered rounds); if every round starves it raises
`DeviceLockContended` (`503 device_lock_contended` on activate; swallowed on
the request path, leaving the licence unbound for the next request). Details:
[CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) §20.1.

## 2026-09-23 — Upload gives up on missing files (#148)

**Upload stops retrying a session whose files are gone
(#148, merged 2026-09-23).** `DicUploadWorker` returned `Result.retry()`
forever when report staging came out incomplete, so a session whose `.dat`
files had been deleted sat on "upload pending" for days (Pixel 6, since
2026-09-21). `UploadWorkOutcomes.classifyIncompleteStaging` now keeps retrying
only while the inputs are on disk, the row was saved under 15 min ago, or they
have been missing for under 10 min (timed by an `upload_inputs_missing_since`
marker in the session folder and restarted whenever the row is re-saved, so a
re-run's brief `.dat` gap does not count). Otherwise the worker fails with
`cloud_backup_failed_missing_files`, which shows on the Home FAILED badge and
its dialog.

## 2026-09-23 — Video sampling and long snackbars (`fix/video-estimate-snackbar`)

**Video sampling and long snackbars (`fix/video-estimate-snackbar`).** The
sampling sheet promised one frame more than a fixed-interval extraction
delivered whenever the segment reached the clip's end: it sampled at the end
itself, where no frame starts. The sheet now caps the segment at
`VideoKeyframeHelper.lastFrameStartMs` and counts `uniformTimestampsUs`, which
the retriever fallback now uses too. `FaqRedirect.snackbar` shows up to five
lines and stays up as long as its message takes to read, capped at 10 s.
Same fix as material_testing #9.

## 2026-09-23 — Quicker session setup (#149)

**Quicker session setup (#149, deployed 2026-09-23).** Two Pixel 6 backups
spent 5.37 s and 3.43 s provisioning inline (a bundle is 3 files, under the
queue threshold). The folder step made three Drive calls in a row; now the
cached `session/` check and the new session folder's create run together, with
no name search for an id minted in the same request, and a retry reuses the
stored folder. `session_provisioned` logs `folderMs`. The next Pixel backup
provisioned in 2.40 s (folders 1.23 s), `POST /v1/sessions` 3.12 s.

## 2026-09-23 — App Check on real phones (`fix/appcheck-real-phones`, merged as #153)

**App Check attests on real phones (branch `fix/appcheck-real-phones`).** The
provider was skipped whenever the `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` build flag was on — every
debug build, real phones included. It now keys on the bypass being active
(emulator only). That exposed that the Auth project has the App Check and Play
Integrity APIs disabled, so no build had ever sent a token. Both APIs are now
enabled and the app is registered with Play Integrity; the Play Console link
waits for a Play developer account (AUTH_SETUP §3.2, gate). Harmless while
`APP_CHECK_MODE=off`.

## 2026-09-23 — Deploys prune their tags (#151)

**Deploys prune their tags (#151, deployed 2026-09-23).** The promote
routes `--to-latest` and drops every `cand-*` tag in the same call (TD-32
closed; #151, deployed to both environments with no tags left).

## 2026-09-23 — Backend names standardised (#146)

**Backend names standardised (2026-09-23, #146, deployed).** Cloud Run
services are rebuilt as `semper-api` / `semper-api-staging` with queues
`semper-provision` / `semper-provision-staging`; the gateways point at them and
the old `indic-api*` services, their images and the `indic-provision` queue are
deleted. Rollback images: `semper-api:rollback-c0c0ce3`,
`semper-api-staging:rollback-prev`.
Staging now has its own queue and task target (environment-scoped GitHub vars).
The legacy `indic-gw` gateway is deleted. Service-account emails and project IDs
keep their `indic-*` names — see the names table in
[docs/ops/ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md).

[Note 2026-09-23: unverified from the repo — [TECH_DEBT.md](TECH_DEBT.md) TD-30
still lists the legacy `indic-gw` / `indic-api` pair as provisioned. Check with
`gcloud api-gateway gateways list` before relying on either statement.]

## 2026-09-23 — Video import reads AVI (#136, #137, #139)

**Video import reads AVI (#136, #137, #139, merged 2026-09-23).** #136 landed
the keyframe/uniform extraction path that pulls frames out of the raw Y plane;
#137 fixed its fixed-interval mode, which had returned the preceding I-frame
for every sample (the decoder now decodes forward to the requested timestamp);
#139 adds the container Android itself cannot open. `AviReader` demuxes RIFF,
`AviLuma` reads the uncompressed layouts losslessly, `MjpegHuffman` repairs
tableless motion-JPEG frames and `AviCodecDecoder` hands Xvid/H.264 samples to
the platform codecs — no new dependency, no APK growth. A codec the device
cannot decode is now named in the error instead of failing blank. On an emulator
(`VideoFrameExtractionDeviceTest`) two more decoder faults surfaced and are fixed on
`test/video-extraction-emulator`: a fixed-interval segment ending at the clip's
duration asked for a time past the last frame, failed, and dropped the whole batch
to the retriever's I-frame seek; and a flush before the codec's first output lost
its SPS/PPS, so an extraction intermittently fell back the same way. Neither path
has run on a physical device yet (vendor strides, crop; a real camera AVI):
[docs/app/WORKFLOWS.md](../app/WORKFLOWS.md) §5.1a. The same change is being ported to `sempermechanics/material_testing`.

## 2026-09-23 — Faster sign-in, upload and restore (#142)

**Faster sign-in, upload and restore; failures that say so (#142, merged
and deployed 2026-09-23).** Launch opens Home
from the cached approval and re-checks in the background (`StatusRecheck`);
`/v1/me` and `/v1/config` run in parallel. Signed calls carry a device-minted
`t1.` nonce instead of fetching a challenge first — one round-trip fewer per
call, falling back to challenges after any refusal
([CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md §3](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md)).
The backend caches the user's Drive folder IDs, provisions manifests of eight
files or fewer inline, keeps one warm instance in production with one worker,
logs a failed Cloud Tasks enqueue at ERROR, and answers `drive_file_gone`
instead of a retried 502 when a backed-up file is gone from Drive. `/readyz`
is off the gateway, staging deploys private, and the setup guide no longer
advises `allUsers`. It first served as `c0c0ce3` on `indic-api`; after the
rename (#146) production is `semper-api-35844549945-1` (`d518179`, one warm
instance) behind gateway config `v202609230845`, and the old service, its
`cand-*` tags and the older gateway configs are deleted. The Cloud Tasks
`serviceAccountUser` grant and the staging deployer invoker are applied.
Still owed: proof that the next backup goes through `semper-provision`, and
the app side (ships with the next release) —
[PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md).
Rollback: `gcloud run deploy semper-api --image
…/cloud-run-source-deploy/semper-api:rollback-c0c0ce3`.

## 2026-09-21 to 2026-09-23 — Licensing live in production, and the console fixes (#116–#138)

**Licensing is live in production (2026-09-21/22).** `indic-api` serves
`d6b1b64` (`main` after #116) behind the `semper-gw` gateway config
`v202609211150`; `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER` is gone from the service env and
`DEMO_MAX_ANALYSES=25` is the demo cap. Every pre-existing account resolved to
demo on its first request; the installed pre-licensing build was verified
against production (backup, delete, export work; restore is refused once
with a readable sentence). The dashboards are deployed on
`app.sempermechanics.com` (Firebase Hosting custom domain, Netlify DNS) with
Identity Platform + TOTP-only MFA, and `sempermechanics.com/login|account|terms`
redirect there.

Everything since is the staff console meeting a real browser, plus one
backend bug it found. The consoles: #117–#118 (refused cloud download says
why; the Firestore index file kept only the one real composite — production
had none before this rollout), then #120–#128 — `<base>` href, theme, CSP
origins, `init.json`, one SDK origin, no-cache — and #129 the TOTP QR,
#130 the role gate (a non-operator is told where they *can* go instead of
being shown a mint form that refuses), #132 the re-authentication loop
(firebase-auth resolves a redirect's second-factor challenge against
`auth.redirectUser`, so the fresh `auth_time` never reached `currentUser`
and a revoke bounced to Google forever; the desk now also resumes the
revoke itself on the return leg). The backend: #131 — the mint routes
returned the `SERVER_TIMESTAMP` sentinel they had just written, so a
successful mint answered 500 and the licence existed anyway — and #134,
`ADMIN_EMAILS` parsed like `CONSOLE_ORIGINS` because the deploy action
splits `env_vars` pairs on commas and the list now names two operators.
#133 made the emulator tier's two invite races deterministic: a round the
emulator starves grants nothing, so it is re-raced rather than asserted on.
`fix/deflake-individual-licence-test` does the same for
`test_one_individual_licence_reaches_exactly_one_account` (test-only; a
starved round must answer `_contended` to all and leave the licence unused).
The repository is public as of 2026-09-22 (CI minutes; the engine submodule
was already public), and `damodar@indicvision.com` is the second operator.

**#131 is deployed** (2026-09-23): production serves `7593692` as revision
`indic-api-35821056144-1`, the first with both operators' `ADMIN_EMAILS`
pinned by the workflow. #138 (merged and deployed to Hosting 2026-09-23) fixes the desk's silence: a revoke that
failed said nothing and one that worked stayed listed until a reload,
because redirect re-authentication started the page twice and the list
reload cleared the result. It also makes a duplicate mint for one address
ask first — the backend is licence-first by design, so the 500 retry had
left `SEMP-5MZP` beside `SEMP-EQUZ` (revoked 2026-09-23)
([CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) §20.3,
§20.8, now with the browser and gateway in §1). Still open in
[docs/ops/PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md)
"Licensing rollout": the first minted licence, the staff
hand-check of `/login` as an ordinary account holder, the new-build
demo-key check, and the 24 h log watch. Rollback targets: Cloud Run
revision `indic-api-00067-mbp` (pre-licensing `indic-api-31896308319-1`),
gateway config `v202608081145`.

## 2026-09-19 — Licensing (#100, #110, #111)

**Licensing ([#100](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semperdic-app/pull/100),
merged 2026-09-19; go-live follow-up
[#110](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semperdic-app/pull/110) and the
link fix #111 merged the same day).** `main` is deployable; nothing has been
deployed yet — production Cloud Run is still `bcc467a` and the gateway config
predates licensing. What is left is ops, at the end of this
section and, checkbox by checkbox, in the "Licensing rollout" section of
[docs/ops/PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md). It extends flat demo/licensed into two licensed
shapes and one roster mechanism. Organised below by subject, not by the order
the branch built it in. Full model:
[docs/backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md)
§20. What follows is the map of decisions that are expensive to rediscover and
easy to undo by accident.

*Shape.* `kind` is `individual` or `institution`, `duration` is `perpetual` or
`timed`, `seating` is `assigned` or `floating`. The three are orthogonal, and
contradictory combinations are refused at mint. Institution seats live at
`licenses/{id}/seats/{uid}`. A floating licence's `maxSeats` caps *concurrent*
leases while the roster stays uncapped — fifty people sharing ten slots — and a
member between leases is demo, the ordinary state rather than a failure. The
lease lives on the seat document, not a `leases` collection, because
`check_device_lock` already reads that document on every institution request;
its expiry is mirrored onto the user so `effective_mode` needs no Firestore
read. `assigned` is the default and means what every pre-existing licence
already meant, so neither seating nor duration needed a migration.

*Terms are mirrored, so editing a licence reaches nobody on its own.*
`resolve_user_config` is deliberately free of Firestore reads, which means
expiry and grace are copied onto each user at activation, and
`PATCH /v1/admin/licenses/{id}` has to fan renewed terms out to the individual
redeemer or every non-revoked seat. A timed licence keeps **full** entitlements
for `graceDays` past `expiresAt` — grace is inside the licensed branch, not a
reduced tier — and a licence stored with no `graceDays` reads as ZERO rather
than the fleet default, or deploying it would have reinstated everyone who had
expired inside the window. Activating past grace is refused (`license_expired`,
403) rather than landing the user silently on demo. The app shows a Home notice
inside 14 days of expiry or during grace, suppressed when its cached config is
over a week old: advisory only, `mode` is still the only gate.

*Revoke and downgrade.* Whole-key revoke drops every seat to demo and frees all
slots; single-seat revoke frees only that slot; disable drops to demo but keeps
the slot held. Downgrade never deletes data — it only blocks new analyses past
the cap, pinned by a test that seeds 30 sessions, downgrades, reactivates, and
loses nothing.

*Nothing is ever typed.* Both shapes are minted against an email address, which
writes `licenseInvites/{sha256(email)}`; that person's next sign-in redeems it
through `claim_pending_invite`, which grants either the licence itself or a
seat. Top-level and hashed: one document read on a hot path rather than a
collection-group query, and a plaintext address would be both an illegal
document id and enumerable. Redemption requires a **verified** email, since the
address is the whole claim to the licence. `ensure_entitlement` tries the
invite *before* `ensure_demo_license`, which stamps a `licenseId` that every
later call short-circuits on. `POST /v1/licenses/activate` and
`IndicApi.activateLicense()` survive as support recovery, with no caller in
`app/src/`.

*The device lock binds on first use.* `_device_lock_state` answers **unbound**
for a licence or seat that has not met a device, and `revalidate_device_lock` —
already on every authed request carrying `X-Device-Id` — binds it
transactionally, first writer wins. `ensure_demo_license` is a compare-and-set
for the same reason: it used to write blind, so of several requests racing at
launch the loser could stamp a demo key over the licence a sibling had just
granted. A claim also deletes the auto-minted demo key it supersedes
(`_drop_superseded_demo`, after the commit rather than inside it — reading the
account in the claim's own transaction locks it, and six concurrent sign-ins
then starve each other out), discriminating on `mode: demo` **and**
`createdByUid: "system"` on the licence, never the holder's mode mirror, which
revocation deliberately leaves demoted-in-place. A claim that merely lost the
race answers with a private `_CONTENDED` logged at `info` and mapped back by
`_public_claim_error`, so contention stops reading in the logs like a licence
with no room left; and a failed claim re-reads the account instead of returning
the caller's pre-race copy, which is what the consoles need, since a browser
sends no `X-Device-Id`. Revoking withdraws the licence's outstanding invites,
and `_write_invite` overwrites one whose licence is revoked or gone, so
mint → revoke → re-mint to the same address delivers. Three emulator tests
cover the three races (one redeemer, one invite, one device); seat
claim/revoke/checkout/release run under real transactions that fail closed,
after a read-then-`WriteBatch` was found able to push a pool past `maxSeats`.

*Moving to another device is a clear, not a revoke.* One primitive,
`clear_device_lock(license_id, uid, actor=…)`, behind four routes: the IT seat
patch, a staff seat clear (`PATCH /v1/admin/licenses/{id}/seats/{uid}/device`),
`clearDeviceLock` on the staff licence patch, and `POST /v1/licenses/unbind`
for the holder. Emptying the lock is the whole change, since the next device to
sign in takes it. `_restore_holder_mode` re-stamps the mode as part of the
clear: a device change is normally preceded by the holder *trying* the new
phone, which demotes the account in place, and `revalidate_device_lock` returns
early for a demo account — without it the clear would leave them on demo
holding a live licence. It is guarded (not a revoked licence, not a revoked or
disabled seat, not an account that has moved on) and runs outside the
transaction. The holder's own path alone waits on
`SELF_DEVICE_CHANGE_COOLDOWN_DAYS` (30) against a `deviceChangedAt` only it
writes, because a second factor proves who is asking and not how often; staff
and IT never read or write it, so support always works. Both halves of a change
are audited, and operators can read the history per licence. **Restore has an
order**: sign in, let one authed request bind the lock, then restore — file
content is device-attested, so restoring first fails as unlicensed on a phone
the user has legitimately just moved to.

*A revoke reaches three places on three clocks, and IT sees only one.*
`seatsUsed` moves inside the revoke transaction; the holder's user document
just after it (`_drop_user_to_demo_if_licensed`, outside the transaction and
unretried); the holder's *device* only at its next `/v1/config` fetch. So the
institution console can report intent and nothing more.
`GET /v1/admin/licenses/{id}/reconcile` is the second number — a plain `ADMIN`
read, one user lookup per seat, sorting each into `active` (with
`never_claimed` for a roster place nobody took up), `revokedConfirmed` or
`revokedStillRunning`, each with a reason. Confirmation takes **two**
conditions, because the demotion already runs at revoke time and a bucket keyed
on stored mode alone would read clean almost always: the record has caught up
**and** `lastSeenAt > revokedAt`. `still_licensed` is a fault, repaired by
revoking again (idempotent); `no_checkin_since_revoke` is waited out. It reads
**stored** mode, never `effective_mode`, under which a floating member between
leases — the ordinary state for most of a roster — would report a healthy pool
as mass revoke failure. Both revoke paths stamp `revokedAt` apart from
`updatedAt`, which a later staff device clear would otherwise reset.
`lastSeenAt` is throttled to an hour, which would have made the read
over-report unlanded revokes for that long; the revoke stamps
`seenCheckpointAt` on the holder in the write the demotion already makes, and
a `lastSeenAt` older than that checkpoint is stale whatever its age — so the
holder's next request confirms the revoke, at the cost of one un-throttled
write per revoked account.

*Three authz tiers, deliberately distinct.* Institution IT authenticates on
`current_user` + APPROVED + verified email in that licence's `adminEmails` — no
device attestation and not Semper `role=admin`, so IT self-service never needs
a phone. `ADMIN_STEPUP` accepts either a device attestation or an admin ID
token carrying a completed second factor from a sign-in newer than
`ADMIN_WEB_REAUTH_SECONDS` (15 min; whole-licence revoke uses the tighter
`ADMIN_WEB_REVOKE_REAUTH_SECONDS`). It is weaker than device binding — a
phished live MFA session inside the window can mint a licence — which is why it
is its own tier rather than folded into `DEVICE_ADMIN`, and why
`ADMIN_WEB_MFA_ENABLED=0` withdraws it. `USER_STEPUP` is the same shape with
`current_user` beneath it (one shared `_attested_or_mfa`), carrying
`/v1/licenses/unbind` and `GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/bundle`. Every route has a row
in `tests/test_route_authz_matrix.py` and a declaration in
`gateway/openapi.yaml`; `tests/test_gateway_parity.py` fails the build on a
missing one, because ESPv2 is an allowlist and an undeclared route is
unreachable in production with nothing in the logs — a trap that has bitten
twice.

[Note 2026-09-23: institution IT now also needs the browser second factor —
`institution_admin_stepup`,
[CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) §20.4.]

*Four web pages, one front door.* `/login` reads `GET /v1/me` and
`GET /v1/institutions/licenses` and forwards: staff to `/console/operator`, an
address named on a live licence's `adminEmails` to `/console/institution`
(deep-linked when there is exactly one), everyone else to `/account`. That
listing is a route rather than a field on `/v1/me`, which promises no extra
Firestore read and is called on every app launch; it is one `array_contains` on
`adminEmails` with kind and status filtered in Python, so no composite index.
`/login` and `/account` are Hosting rewrites into `/console/`, which is why the
relaxed console CSP is restated for them — a header matches the request path,
not the rewrite target — and why every page carries a `<base href>`. Each page
loads one ES module from a file beside it: **inline scripts do not run**, since
the console CSP is `script-src 'self'` with no `'unsafe-inline'`.
`scripts/check_console.py` (CI job `console-pages`, unfiltered) is the consoles'
only gate — they have no compiler — and it is what found all four pages inlined.
TOTP enrolment shows the secret for manual entry, since posting it to a QR
service would hand away the factor protecting licence issuance; SMS is never
enabled, so `auth.js` carries no phone branch. An analysis leaves through
`GET /v1/sessions/{sid}/bundle`: one `ZIP_STORED` archive over every completed
artifact — not a proxy of the stored `Session.zip`, which would drop the
`extras` zip modern sessions also carry — streamed into an unseekable sink so
600 files cost flat memory, with every refusal resolved before the first byte,
since a started body has no status code left. `list_session_artifacts` is kept
apart from the projection feeding `/v1/me/export`, so a field added here can
never widen the GDPR export.

*On the phone.* `seatRequiredToStart` is a **parallel** predicate to the quota
gate — an institution member is licensed, so `isSessionLimitReached` is false
for them by definition and they would sail past every existing check. It gates
the Home **+** before the source menu opens, and both compute paths, guarded by
`wouldCreateNewSession()` so a run in flight never aborts; `SeatRequiredActivity`
is one button that asks again, because seats free themselves. Floating seats
renew in-process on `seatHeartbeatMinutes` and release on sign-out, and a
four-hour `LicenseConfigWorker` refreshes `/v1/config` so an idle phone learns a
remote revoke (FI-16: four hours is the worst case, and shortening the interval
is the wrong lever — it costs every device every day to reach one). Demo
accounts upload silently (see *Demo records* below) but never open the share
sheet; restore maps
`license_device_mismatch` to a bind-first message. Settings → Account shows the
licence **prefix**, which is what support asks for; the key itself never
reaches the device.

*Traps.* `SCHEMA_VERSION` is 2
(`002_rename_campus_to_institution.py`, the first migration to include
`licenses`). The wire said `campus` and `plan: demo|professional`; it now says
`institution` and `mode: demo|licensed`, and every skew fallback is temporary —
the `plan` mirror on `/v1/config`, the hidden `/v1/campus/*` aliases (declared
in the gateway, or ESPv2 rejects them), the old pref key on upgrade,
`kind="campus"` still accepted at mint. Retirement order:
CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP §20.5. Licences are still keyed by the sha256 of their
key; opaque ids wait for the change that needs them, a licence with no key at
all. `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER` is **deleted**, not merely unread: `mode` selects
between `DEMO_MAX_ANALYSES` (25) and `LICENSED_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER`, so **a
deployment still setting the old variable silently gets 25 instead of 4**.

*Demo records; only retrieval is licensed (2026-09-19 decision).* A demo
account's analyses are uploaded and stored — images and results — but demo has
no backup/restore *feature*. On the backend that means `POST /v1/sessions` and
the upload broker are open to every approved account and the
`cloudBackupEnabled` gate sits only on `GET /v1/files/{id}/content` and the
session bundle. The reason is the installed fleet: every pre-licensing account
resolves to demo on its first request after the deploy, and the old
`DicUploadWorker` retries a 403 from session creation forever, whereas the old
restore worker gives up on 403 once. So the old app keeps backing up and shows
a single "rejected" on restore. In the new app demo sees **nothing** of cloud:
`CloudSync.uploadsEnabled` ignores the Save-to-cloud toggle for demo, Home
paints no sync badge or row progress, Settings has no Cloud / Analyses-data
section and no Free-up or auto-free control, and `StorageBudget` refuses to
evict on demo because the copy could not come back. Minting an individual
licence for an address that already has an approved, verified account attaches
it at mint time (`_attach_to_existing_holder`) instead of leaving an invite
that `claim_pending_invite` would skip over the stamped demo key.
`deploy-backend.yml` now pins `DEMO_MAX_ANALYSES`,
`LICENSED_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER`, `ADMIN_WEB_MFA_ENABLED`, `APP_CHECK_MODE` and
`SELF_DEVICE_CHANGE_COOLDOWN_DAYS` with safe expression defaults and warns when
the retired `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER` is still on the service. Still open: one
sentence in the Privacy Policy / Terms saying demo analyses are uploaded, and
the Play Data-safety form — both listed in the readiness gate.

*Dashboards on `app.sempermechanics.com`; CORS (`feat/console-domain-cors`).*
The consoles are hard-bound to Firebase Hosting (`auth.js` imports the SDK and
`firebaseConfig` from the reserved `/__/firebase/` namespace; `/login` and
`/account` are Hosting rewrites), and `sempermechanics.com` is the Netlify
marketing site, so the dashboards get a **custom domain** on the auth Hosting
site rather than a copy: `app.sempermechanics.com`. The marketing site links
"Sign in" there and redirects `/login`, `/account` and `/terms/` — the last
fixes a live 404 that `backend/app/legal.py` and the Terms clickwrap were
already pointing at. The same host carries the app's auth continue links under
`/auth/` (`AUTH_HOST`), with the `firebaseapp.com` host kept as
`LEGACY_AUTH_HOST` for every installed build and for the password-reset action
URL (TD-29). Found on the way: the API had **no CORS at all** — no middleware,
no `allowCors` on the gateway — so a console `fetch` carrying `Authorization`
was preflighted and refused at the edge from any origin. `CONSOLE_ORIGINS`
(Cloud Run, pinned by the workflow) plus `x-google-endpoints … allowCors` with
the `__MANAGED_SERVICE__` placeholder in `gateway/openapi.yaml` (the API's
managed service name — not the gateway hostname, which ESPv2 ignores) close that;
`test_security_controls.py` pins the preflight. The gateway must be redeployed
from the new spec before the consoles are usable.

*Go-live is ops, not code.* Identity Platform has to be enabled with TOTP on and
SMS off, or the consoles sign in and every write fails `mfa_required`; the API
Gateway has to be redeployed, since the backend workflow does not touch it; then
[`scripts/deploy-console.sh`](../../scripts/deploy-console.sh), whose trap restores
the `__API_BASE_URL__` / `__API_ORIGIN__` placeholders that
`check_console.py` insists stay placeholders. Steps and failure symptoms are in

## 2026-09-19 — Architecture pass on the licensing branch

**An architecture pass on the same branch closed four things and deferred
three.** It read the app against the standard boundaries — hoisted UI state,
main-safe I/O, injected dependencies, attested network calls — and the findings
worth acting on were the ones that cost correctness rather than shape.

*App Check answers a question an ID token cannot.* `verify_id_token` attests the
account and `deps.verified_device` attests the device, but neither says which
*binary* is calling, and the Firebase Web API key that mints an ID token ships
inside the APK as an identifier rather than a secret — so a script holding a
valid sign-in could drive `POST /v1/licenses/checkout` and hoard a floating
pool. The phone now attaches `X-Firebase-AppCheck` from a host-scoped OkHttp
interceptor, and `current_user` demands one **only from a caller sending
`X-Device-Id`**: the app always sends it and a browser never does, so the four
consoles are exempt by construction rather than by a route list somebody has to
keep in step. The check runs *before* `get_or_create_user`, so a caller on its
way to being refused neither creates an account row nor moves a device lock, and
it answers `app_check_required`, not `not_approved` — the account may be
perfectly entitled. `APP_CHECK_MODE` is `off` (default) / `monitor` / `enforce`,
and a fourth value fails startup rather than quietly disabling the gate. Play
Integrity is the only provider installed: the debug provider needs a per-install
secret registered by hand, and the interceptor fails open, so a developer build
simply sends no header against `off` or `monitor`.

*429 and 503 are not the same answer, and `RetryOnTransient` does not treat them
alike.* 429 is retried unconditionally — the per-instance token bucket and the
gateway quota both reject *before* the handler runs, so nothing happened and a
repeat is not a second write. 503 carries no such promise, since ESPv2 emits it
on both sides of handing the request on, so it is retried for GET and for the
two POSTs that are idempotent by contract (`/v1/licenses/checkout`, whose repeat
*is* the heartbeat, and `/v1/licenses/release`). Session create and the upload
broker are deliberately absent: a duplicate there costs a Drive object. Three
attempts, `Retry-After` preferred over the backoff and clamped; the long game
stays WorkManager's, and this layer exists for the interactive calls that have
no second chance and used to surface a one-second throttle as a flat failure.

*Four session-index reads still ran from a tap*, in Home and Settings backup,
the session-limit recheck and the viewer's share path. Both backup sites keep
their write order rather than turning optimistic: the PENDING stamp lands before
`CloudSync.enqueueUpload`, or an upload that finishes first has its SYNCED stamp
overwritten by a late PENDING. The viewer warms its `sessionRecord` lazy in
`onCreate` instead of restructuring `ShareCenter` — `by lazy` is synchronized,
so a tap arriving mid-read waits on the read it would have done itself and never
on a second one. `SessionStore`'s blocking accessors carry `@WorkerThread` as
documentation only; see TD-24 for why that is half a pair. And the parameter
sweep moved from the Activity's `lifecycleScope` onto `viewModelScope`, emitting
progress and outcome as `SharedFlow`, so a rotation mid-sweep no longer throws
the run away.

[Note 2026-09-23: `StaticAnalysisActivity` declares full `configChanges`
(`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`), so a rotation does not recreate the
wizard; the remaining risk is process death —
[ADR-005](../adr/ADR-005-wizard-process-death.md).]

*The three deferrals each name their blocker.* TD-24: `@MainThread` on ~27
Activities is the other half of the thread contract, and needs a lint run to
land against an empty baseline. TD-25: `AuthRepository` has no fake backend to
test against, because `IndicApi` is final with a private constructor — a seam
there admits only the real client, so it wants the interface extraction that
CONTRIBUTING defers to a DI PR of its own. TD-26: wizard and viewer UI state
still lives on the Activity rather than hoisted as `StateFlow`, on a 1.8k-line
native-solve screen with bit-exact `.dat` oracles; the part that was losing work
was the run, and the run is now on `viewModelScope`.

## 2026-09-18 — Terms clickwrap (#109)

**Terms clickwrap (merged to `main` in #109, and into `feat/license-demo-pro`
on 2026-09-18).** The Terms of
Service were rewritten from the owner's side (IP and anti-reverse-engineering,
acceptable use, AS-IS warranty disclaimer, capped liability, indemnity, sole
discretion termination, Indian law with Chennai arbitration and a class waiver,
professional use only, not offered in the EU/UK) and the Privacy Policy brought
to a GDPR-grade standard without EU/UK-specific commitments (grievance officer,
consent-based product improvement, transfers, breach handling, full rights
list). Hosted pages regenerated. Acceptance is now a **clickwrap**:
`AccessRouter.intentFor` sends every sign-in through `TermsActivity` until the
device has accepted the version in force; the backend records it
(`POST /v1/me/terms`, 409 on a stale app) and a separate, pre-ticked-but-declinable, withdrawable
improvement consent (`PUT /v1/me/consents`, Settings → Your data). Details in
[docs/backend/AUTH_SETUP.md](../backend/AUTH_SETUP.md) §3a. Bracketed operator
fields in both documents still have to be filled before public distribution.

## 2026-09 — Backend lock regeneration in CI (#105)

**Backend lock regeneration is a CI workflow now, not a local chore**
([#105](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semperdic-app/pull/105)). Dependabot
bumps `backend/requirements.txt` and cannot produce the hashed
`requirements.lock`, so every backend bump used to land Tier 4 red — #103 left
`main` red for exactly that reason. `.github/workflows/backend-lock.yml`
compiles on Linux / Python 3.12, verifies on any PR touching either file
(attaching the regenerated lock as an artifact), and pushes on
`workflow_dispatch` against a chosen branch. See
[docs/ops/CI.md](CI.md) § Dependabot cheap path.

[Note 2026-09-23: the push uses the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`git push` at
`.github/workflows/backend-lock.yml:127`), and a push made with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
does not start a new workflow run. A Dependabot PR fixed this way keeps its old
red checks until they are re-run by hand.]

## Undated (before #100) — camera removal, import and sweep fixes, security pass

Lint and detekt burn-down on this branch: empty baselines still; `:app:detekt`
and `:app:lintDebug` report zero findings. Settings / wizard settings content
inflates through `SettingsScrollContentView` /
`WizardStepSettingsContentView`. `OldTargetApi` stays disabled until a
deliberate targetSdk PR.

**The in-app camera recording feature has been removed.** Home **+** now opens
the import source chooser directly; there is one acquisition path. Deleted with
it: `ui/capture/` in full, the `CAMERA` permission and camera `<queries>`, the
two capture activities, and the measured **capture noise floor** end to end —
the stored `SessionRecord.captureFloor`, its viewer caption, its CSV preamble
line and its PDF cover section.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **The CSV's rigid-body motion columns survived and became unconditional.**
  `shift_u_px, shift_v_px, shift_rot_deg` used to be gated on a session having a
  measured floor, which tied an export column to the camera by accident. The fit
  is read off the solved field itself (`RigidBodyFit`), so every session now
  carries the columns; a frame that admits no fit writes three empty ones.
- **`SubsetRecommender` is back on the paper's constant.** The measured
  `D(eta)` came from the capture burst and no import can supply it. Since
  `thresholdFor` clamps to `max(measured, NOISE_VARIANCE)`, recommendations can
  only loosen slightly, and only relative to runs this app captured itself.

Upgrade safety is pinned by `SessionStoreLegacyFloorTest`: `SessionStore`'s
parser is built with `ignoreUnknownKeys`, so an `index.json` written before the
removal — still carrying its `captureFloor` object — loads unchanged. No
migration.

`NoiseFloorPixels` / `NoiseFloorProbe` / `NoiseFloorStats` stay in
`ui/analysis/`: they take plain arrays or raw image bytes, so they judge an
imported frame as readily as a captured one.

`SpeckleScale` and `DicGoodPractice` came the same way and now have a caller.
`SubsetRecommender.recommend` measures the speckle diameter by autocorrelation on
the very patches it already reads for SSSIG — no extra decode — and returns the
median as `Result.speckleDiameterPx`. The wizard's first step reports it against
the iDICs 3-9 px band: a muted readout under the subset slider whenever it is
measurable, and a warning chip when the pattern is under- or over-resolved, or
when the recommended subset would not span three dots.

The two speckle chips answer different questions and neither substitutes for the
other. SSSIG is a *sum* of gradients over a subset, so it clears its threshold on
a pattern far too fine to resolve simply by growing the subset; speckle size is
what the guidance is actually written against, and what the user can fix at the
bench. The size measurement only reports — it does not steer the recommended
subset, which stays the SSSIG answer.


`RawRgba` closed the DNG-in-`RoiDrawActivity` gap:
one shared helper detects a `w*h*4` blob and samples straight into a
preview-sized bitmap, so the full-resolution allocation never happens.

Import measures a frame the way the engine will see it: `ExifOrientedSize`
applies the EXIF orientation tag to `BitmapFactory`'s bounds, because OpenCV's
`imdecode` rotates and `BitmapFactory` does not. Without it one portrait photo
picked as both reference and deformed frame reported a size mismatch against
itself (4080×3072 vs 3072×4080).

A sweep now runs its whole plan. `ConvergenceGate` is the batch path only:
a batch's consecutive solves are successive frames, so decorrelation means
every later frame is worse, but a sweep's are parameter combinations on one
frame pair, ordered smallest subset first — exactly the ones most likely to
under-converge. The gate was killing sweeps in their opening combinations.

The wizard's inline format warning names whichever formats in the set are not
lossless (`LossyFormatCheck`), reference included, instead of only saying
"JPEG".

**Security pass on this branch.** `_emails_conflict` fails closed, so a token
with no email cannot adopt a device-bound account, and adoption additionally
requires `email_verified`. First-sign-in profile creation uses `create()`
rather than `set()`, so a launch race cannot reset an approved profile to
PENDING. The device signature covers the query string when a request has one.
`AuthActivity` checks arriving auth links against `AUTH_HOST` before handing an
`oobCode` to Firebase — the activity is exported, so an explicit intent
bypasses the App Link filter. The ROI mask read and the RAW reference copy in
`StaticAnalysisActivity` moved off the main thread.

The Demo/Professional plan and license-key work that was mixed into this
working tree belongs to **`feat/license-demo-pro`** and was moved there: no
`plan`, entitlement flags, or license fields are part of the user account
definition on this branch.

`origin/main` includes PRs #85–#96 (FAQ error map), the Dependabot batch
#102–#104, and #93 (Tier 3 microbenchmark skip + hashed lock). Open follow-up:
wizard step/overlap + step-2/3 reorder
([#97](https://github.com/sempermechanics/semperdic-app/pull/97)).
Refresh with `gh pr list --state open` — anything named here will rot.

New analysis picks media in-sheet (Images gallery; **Files** dismisses the sheet
and opens SAF). The reference picker opens full height and dims the grid for
1 s behind a large centred hint ("Select the reference image"); deformed
multi-select stays immediate. Wizard warnings (JPEG, low speckle, speckle size,
frame-size
mismatch, ROI too small, empty/too-big sweep plan) and remaining actionable
errors (engine failure dialog **Why?** plus a lasting ⓘ on the status line,
import / video, viewer batch/OOM/scale, lattice hollow nodes) link to Troubleshooting
sections on the public site behind a leave-the-app confirm; canonical copy in
[docs/app/FAQ.md](../app/FAQ.md) with map in
[docs/app/FAQ_LINKS.md](../app/FAQ_LINKS.md). Frame-size copy names the
mismatched files. `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` / `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` are requested when
the gallery tab needs them. Summary GIFs bake `viewer_canvas` (night `#101518`)
into the cache filename. Summary overview and the Animations share target are
single-setting only; a parameter sweep has neither. Launcher adaptive background is day `#F4F9FC` / night
`#101518`; night inverts the S on splash (`windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`).

Viewer chrome is inset-aware glass: heatmap rest-fit contains the ROI or
accepted points between the top bar and the scrub bar (colour scale overlays
the right edge), field switcher as a top-left glass pill with the live field
checked in its popup, auto-hiding on a timer, restored by a centre double-tap
when faded. A short tap anywhere on the figure probes. On a still frame the
ⓘ sheet quotes true min/max/mean and a histogram of accepted values. The
looping summary GIF uses one colour scale from every frame's trimmed ends
(lowest min, highest max, possibly from different frames); its ⓘ sheet
quotes those same ends without mean or histogram. Settings' Analyses rows
carry three actions — **Download** (SAF destination first, then a worker),
**Restore** (only when local frames are gone) and **Delete**. The sweep
lattice's plot toggle is an **All / Node** pill defaulting to **All**; the scrub
readout shows x and y.

Docs for all of the above: [docs/app/WORKFLOWS.md](../app/WORKFLOWS.md) (the
manual test pass). Every workflow — app, background and backend — mapped to its
files, failure surfaces and tests: [docs/WORKFLOWS.md](../WORKFLOWS.md);
proposals coming out of that map: [docs/ops/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md](FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md).

A single-setting run that solves zero points shows the same VSG-failure
wording as a sweep lattice node, not the generic "No data produced" dialog.

**Next architecture (grill before coding):** the `DicKeys` extras bag is now
packed in one place — `ViewerArgs` in `ui/viewer/`, which both
`SessionOpenHelper.intentFor` and `AnalysisNavHelper.openResults` construct,
with `ViewerArgsTest` asserting their key sets against each other so they
cannot drift apart again. The unpack half is still four readers parsing the
bundle themselves, and is the larger move: an Intent already in the back stack
has to keep working across an update. Session **commit** still sits on
`AnalysisViewModel`'s public field bag after the JNI loop leaves.
