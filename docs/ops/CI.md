# CI — path-filtered tiers (PR and push)

Defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

**`main` is the only integration branch.** Pull requests target `main`. Every
event runs the always-on gates; the tiers follow the diff:

- Tier 1 (app), Tier 4 (backend) and the Firestore rules tests run when their
  paths change, and on every push to `main`.
- Tier 3 (emulator) and Tier 5 (arm64 release, R8) run when the diff can break
  them — an engine bump or JNI change runs both, a packaging change (keep rules,
  `app/build.gradle.kts`, the version catalog) runs Tier 5 — on a PR and on a
  push to `main` alike. The `e2e` / `release` / `full-ci` labels force both.
- The whole matrix runs **weekly** (Monday 04:17 UTC, `schedule`), with the
  `full-ci` label, or from **Actions → CI → Run workflow** with `full_ci`.

Benchmarks (macro startup and the `HotPathMicroBenchmark` micro suite) run only
with the `benchmark` label or `workflow_dispatch` → `run_benchmark`.

Secrets, vars, and GitHub Environments are mapped in
[ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md).

(*) Tier 3/5 follow the `emulator` / `release_build` flags: engine, JNI and
    packaging paths, the labels, the weekly run. A skipped Tier 1 (an
    engine-only bump) does not skip them; a failed one does.
```

| Job | Proves | Path-filtered? | Typical (warm / cold) |
|-----|--------|---|-----------------------|
| `secret-scan` | gitleaks (see below) | No — always runs | ~1–2 min |
| `legal-pages` | `scripts/render_legal_pages.py --check`: the published pages still match `docs/legal/`; `scripts/check_doc_paths.py`: every path a doc names exists; `scripts/check_framework_coverage.py`: every readiness-framework item (`docs/ops/READINESS_FRAMEWORK_2026-10.md`) has a row in the gate's cross-check and every open row an owner that exists in TECH_DEBT or FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS; `scripts/check_kotlin_file_size.py`: no main Kotlin file over ADR-015's 500-line budget, fused hot loops not counted, the exceptions and their ceilings in `scripts/kotlin_file_size_allowlist.txt` (TD-292); `scripts/check_activity_scope_work.py`: no network call or WorkManager enqueue launched on a screen's `lifecycleScope` (ADR-016 rule 1), the triaged exceptions in `scripts/activity_scope_allowlist.txt` (TD-291); `scripts/check_swallowed_cancellation.py`: no broad catch or `runCatching` around a suspend call in `app/src/main` that swallows `CancellationException` (ADR-018), the triaged exceptions in `scripts/swallowed_cancellation_allowlist.txt` (TD-171); then the stdlib `unittest` suites in `scripts/tests` that test these source checks | No — always runs | seconds |
| `console-pages` | `scripts/check_console.py`: the consoles' wiring, CSP, deploy placeholders and gateway paths — their only gate, since they have no compiler — plus `node --test`: the DOM-free `console/util.js`, `auth.js` (sign-in, second factor, step-up, `api`, revoke gate), `router.js`, and the operator, account and institution pages, against a fake Firebase SDK loaded through a `module.register` hook and a DOM parsed from the real pages (`firebase-hosting/tests/harness.mjs`), with line coverage of the console's JS gated at 96 % by `scripts/console_coverage.mjs` (merged by file from the raw V8 coverage; every `.js` under `public/` but `vendor/`). | No — always runs | seconds |
| `changes` | Resolves path filters + PR/main/Dependabot mode into tier flags | — | seconds |
| `tier1-app-fast` | spotless, detekt, lint, JVM unit tests, `compileReleaseKotlin`, the androidTest and `:benchmark` sources compile, Kover coverage log + `koverVerify` floor. Failing tests are printed by `scripts/ci_test_report.py`, and a test JVM that exits with no failing test by `scripts/ci_test_crash_report.py` (its crash file, heap dump, GC log, last classes and output, TD-312); JUnit XML, the Kover XML/HTML and `app/build/test-crash/` upload as `app-unit-tests-and-coverage` | `app` (PR); always on `main` push | ~5–8 / ~10 min |
| `tier3-emulator-e2e` | x86_64 emulator: the whole androidTest suite except `com.sempermechanics.semper.benchmark` (those need the `benchmark` job) — `EnginePipelineSmokeTest` through the JNI, `AnalysisWizardSmokeTest`, the device tests, and `FirebaseAuthIntegrationTest` signing the CI test account in to the app's Firebase project (secrets `FIREBASE_TEST_EMAIL` / `FIREBASE_TEST_PASSWORD`; it skips without them) | `emulator`: engine / JNI / native-CI actions, labels, weekly | ~20–40 / ~60–90 min |
| `tier4-backend` | ruff, shell-script parse, shellcheck of the two GCP ops scripts, pip-audit, hashed-lock verification, pytest at `--cov-fail-under=93`, then the Firestore emulator suite appended to the same coverage and the total gated at 93. pytest also holds the console gate's own tests (`test_check_console.py`), the index check (`test_firestore_query_indexes.py`) and the wire contracts (`test_wire_contracts.py`, over `contracts/`), the release APK gate's parsers (`test_script_check_release_apk.py`), the framework coverage check (`test_script_check_framework_coverage.py`), and `check_gcp_posture.sh` / `apply-monitoring.sh` run against a stub `gcloud` and `curl` (`test_script_ops_gcp.py`; never a real project) | `backend` (PR); always on `main` push | ~5–10 min |
| `firestore-rules` | `firestore-rules-tests/`: `firestore.rules` on the Firestore emulator (`firebase emulators:exec`, project `demo-rules`) with `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` under `node --test`. For each collection and subcollection `backend/app` uses (`collections.mjs`: `users`, `auth_links`, `devices`, `challenges`, `sessions`, `files`, `licenses`, `licenses/{id}/seats`, `licenseInvites`, `deleted_licenses`, `deleted_licenses/{id}/deleted_seats`, `audit_logs`), signed out, as the owner, as another user and with admin-looking claims, every get, list, owner query, collectionGroup query and write is `assertFails`. `collections.test.mjs` greps `backend/app` for `.collection(…)` / `.collection_group(…)` names and fails when one is missing from the list, so a new collection cannot ship untested. Pinned `firebase-tools`, `firebase` and `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` from `package-lock.json` (`npm ci`, npm cache); the emulator's rule coverage report uploads as `firestore-rules-coverage` | `rules` (PR); always on `main` push | ~1–2 min |
| `tier5-signed-release` | `scripts/check_jni_parity.py` (every `external fun` in `SemperNativeLib` has its `Java_…` export in the pinned engine's `engine/adapters/android`; MT-TE2-001), R8 + signed `assembleRelease` arm64, `.so` presence, signature verify, `scripts/check_release_apk.py` (the APK is not debuggable or testOnly, carries no debug source-set component and no `DebugAppCheckProviderFactory`, permits no cleartext, has `app/build.gradle.kts`'s `minSdk`, and R8 wrote a mapping; it warns when no certificate pin is compiled in, which is always the case here), R8 mapping artifact | `release_build`: engine / JNI / native-CI actions / packaging, labels, weekly | ~15–40 / up to ~90 min |
| `tier-benchmark` | One API 34 emulator, two suites: Macrobenchmark cold/warm startup (`:benchmark`, `suppressErrors=EMULATOR,LOW-BATTERY,UNLOCKED`), then `:app`'s `HotPathMicroBenchmark` on the debug build, installed by Gradle and run with `adb shell am instrument` (`suppressErrors` adds `DEBUGGABLE`, `ACTIVITY-MISSING`, `NOT-AOT-COMPILED`; through Gradle the list arrives cut at its first comma, TD-86; the step fails unless `am instrument` prints `OK (`, and the results are pulled from the device). Emulator **smoke**: no numeric thresholds; both upload their `*-benchmarkData.json` (`macrobenchmark-results`, `microbenchmark-results`). On a PR the micro suite is also a gate: the step before the emulator builds the PR's base and the PR (debug app + androidTest APKs, base first in the one checkout), and `scripts/micro_ab.py` runs each on the emulator in A B B A order and fails if a benchmark's pooled median `timeNs` is more than `microAbMargin` (`benchmark/gates.json`) over the base's (TD-199); the `perf-accepted` label makes it warn instead, and the rounds upload as `microbenchmark-ab`. `scripts/ci_test_report.py` prints failing tests and each metric's min / median / max (`BENCH …` lines) into the log, as Tier 3 does for its failures. CI does not pass `--gates`: the real-device gates (`benchmark/gates.json`, checked only in the phone state `DeviceStateRule` records, [ADR-008](../adr/ADR-008-startup-gates-phone-state.md), [TESTING.md](../app/TESTING.md)) apply to a phone run only. The job reads the app id from `app/build.gradle.kts` (`APP_ID`) for the micro run's `am instrument` and pulls, so it runs unchanged in material_testing. | `benchmark` label / `run_benchmark` dispatch / a PR matching `hot_path` (the micro suite's sources, the benchmark, `scripts/micro_ab.py`, `benchmark/gates.json`) | ~45–75 min |
| `ci-ok` | Single required status check — every job above passed or was skipped | — | seconds |

**There is no tier 2 here any more.** Host C++ builds, the DICe comparisons and
the ASan/UBSan and TSan suites moved to `sempermechanics/semper-dic-engine` along with
the engine sources. This repo only proves the pinned submodule still *links*:
arm64 in tier 5, x86_64 on the emulator in tier 3. `ci-ok` prints a reminder of
where the engine suites live.

## Secret scan (two paths)

`secret-scan` always runs and gates `ci-ok`. How it runs depends on the branch:

| Event | How | Scope |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Human PR / push / dispatch | `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` | Full git history (`fetch-depth: 0`) |
| Dependabot PR (`head_ref` starts with `dependabot/`) | gitleaks **CLI** (no org license / no PR-commits API) | Only `${{ pull_request.base.sha }}..HEAD` |

Key off **`github.head_ref`**, not `actor`: a human rebase of a Dependabot branch
still needs the CLI path because Dependabot PRs do not receive normal Actions
secrets.

- Org / repo secret **`GITLEAKS_LICENSE`** is required for the action path.
- Optional: add the same value under **Settings → Secrets → Dependabot** if you
  later want the action on Dependabot PRs too. Until then the CLI path is enough.

Local repro for a human PR (full history):

```bash
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml
```

Local repro matching Dependabot (PR range only):

```bash
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml --log-opts="<base-sha>..HEAD"
```

## Path filters

| Filter | Paths | Sets |
|--------|-------|------|
| `app` | `app/**`, `benchmark/**`, `gradle/**`, `*.gradle.kts`, `gradle.properties`, `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `settings.gradle.kts`, `contracts/**` | `app` (tier 1) |
| `android_test` | `app/src/androidTest/**` | `app` (tier 1 compiles it) |
| `packaging` | `app/build.gradle.kts`, `app/proguard-rules.pro`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | `app` + `release_build` (tier 5 runs R8) |
| `native_jni` | `engine`, `.gitmodules`, `SemperNativeLib.kt` | `emulator` + `release_build` (tiers 3 + 5) |
| `native_ci` | `.github/actions/{setup-native-ci,enable-kvm,check-arm64-so}/**` | `emulator` + `release_build` |
| `backend` | `backend/**`, `firestore.rules`, `firebase-hosting/firebase.json`, `scripts/deploy-firestore.sh`, `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml`, `docs/legal/**`, `scripts/*.py`, `scripts/tests/**` (the scripts' test fixtures), `scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh`, `scripts/apply-monitoring.sh`, `ops/monitoring/**`, `contracts/**`, and the client's three wire-contract files | `backend` (tier 4) |
| `rules` | `firestore.rules`, `firestore-rules-tests/**`, `backend/app/**` | `rules` (Firestore rules tests) |
| `ci_workflow` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/actions/**`, `scripts/ci_test_report.py` | `app` + `backend` + `rules`, so a workflow-only PR is not gates-only |

The `backend` filter lists every file outside `backend/` that a backend test
reads (`test_security_controls`, `test_terms_and_consent`), plus the ops
scripts, whose only lint is Tier 4's ruff. The console pages under
`firebase-hosting/` are not in it: `console-pages` checks them on every event.

Because the engine is a submodule, `native_jni` matches the **gitlink**
`engine` rather than a source tree — bumping the pinned engine commit is what
triggers it. The JNI adapter is part of the engine
(`engine/adapters/android/`; Gradle builds `engine/CMakeLists.txt`), so a JNI
change arrives as a pin bump too.

The filter step runs with `predicate-quantifier: 'some-with-excludes'`: a file
matches a filter if any of its patterns includes it and no `!` pattern excludes
it. No filter has a `!` pattern since `app/src/main/cpp/` (a dead redirect)
was deleted; the setting stays so the next one holds. Under the default
(`some`), `app`'s old `!app/src/main/cpp/**` matched every file outside
`cpp/`, so `app` was true on every PR and a docs-only PR ran Tier 1 (TD-96).

### What runs for each diff

| Diff class | T1 | T3 | T4 | Rules | T5 |
|------------|----|----|----|-------|-----|
| app Kotlin / resources | run | —† | — | — | —† |
| androidTest only | run (compiles it) | —† | — | — | —† |
| keep rules / app build script / version catalog | run | —† | — | — | run |
| engine pin (JNI adapter included) / `SemperNativeLib.kt` | — (‡) | run | — | — | run |
| `backend/app/**`, `firestore.rules` | — | — | run | run | — |
| `firestore-rules-tests/**` | — | — | — | run | — |
| other backend, Terms, ops scripts | — | — | run | — | — |
| `contracts/**` (shared wire bodies) | run | —† | run | — | —† |
| console pages only | — | — | — | — | — |
| docs only | — | — | — | — | — |
| push to `main` | run | as the diff | run | run | as the diff |
| weekly schedule / `full-ci` label / dispatch `full_ci` | run | run | run | run | run |

† Also with the `e2e`, `release`, or `full-ci` label on the PR.
‡ `SemperNativeLib.kt` is also under `app/**`, so a change to it runs Tier 1 too.

A push to `main` filters against `github.event.before` (the previous `main`
head), so a merge commit is judged by its whole PR. One with no base (a zero
`before`) runs the full matrix. Empty path outputs otherwise fail **closed** to
gates-only (`secret-scan` + `legal-pages` + `console-pages` + `ci-ok`), not a
full matrix.

### Dependabot cheap path

Version updates run monthly, one grouped PR per ecosystem. For pip, Gradle and
Actions only major releases (X.0.0) arrive; minor and patch bumps are ignored
(`dependabot.yml`). That rule does not filter Dependabot **security** updates, which
are a repository setting (Settings → Code security). Docker keeps digest and patch
updates for the base image's OS fixes.

When `github.head_ref` starts with `dependabot/`:

| Ecosystem (from branch name) | Tiers |
|------------------------------|-------|
| `dependabot/pip/…` | gates + Tier 4 |
| `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/…` | gates + Firestore rules (monthly, major-only npm entry for `/firestore-rules-tests` in `dependabot.yml`) |
| `dependabot/gradle/…` | gates + Tier 1 |
| `dependabot/github_actions/…` | gates only — deploy workflows are **not** exercised; read WIF / Cloud Run action inputs by hand before landing |
| `dependabot/docker/…` | gates + Tier 4. Tier 4 runs on the runner's Python 3.12, not the image, so read the base-image change by hand too. `dependabot.yml` ignores Python minor/major bumps: only digest and patch updates arrive while the lock is compiled on 3.12 (TD-68) |

Never Tier 3 / Tier 5 for Dependabot. Path filters use an explicit
`base: pull_request.base.sha` so Dependabot's 403 on the PR Files API does not
fail open into a full matrix.

**A `dependabot/pip/…` PR always lands Tier 4 red, and that is expected.**
Dependabot bumps `backend/requirements.txt` and cannot regenerate the hashed
`requirements.lock`, so tier 4's *Verify the hashed lock* step reports a version
diff. Fix it before merging by running
[`Backend lock`](../../.github/workflows/backend-lock.yml) against the Dependabot
branch — it compiles on Linux / Python 3.12 and pushes the lock to that PR.
That push uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which starts no CI run, so re-run the PR's checks
afterwards (the status stays on the old commit until you do). See
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) § Bumping backend dependencies.

`secret-scan`, `legal-pages` and `console-pages` are absent from the tables on
purpose: they carry no path filter and run on every event.

Skipped jobs count as success for `ci-ok`.

## Required check

**`CI OK`** (`ci-ok`) is the single required status check on `main`: repository
ruleset `main` (id 24720948, set 2026-10-08) requires it on the default branch and
blocks force-push and deletion, with no bypass actors. It gates on all tiers and
treats skipped jobs as passing. Every change reaches `main` through a PR whose
`CI OK` passed; a direct push is refused. That includes the Backend lock workflow:
dispatch it on the PR branch (a Dependabot branch, its purpose), not on `main`.

## Full matrix

- Weekly: `schedule`, Monday 04:17 UTC. It catches what paths cannot: a new
  emulator image, an SDK or runner change, a test that went flaky.
- PR label: `full-ci` (or `e2e` / `release` for Tier 3 + 5 without the rest)
- Or: Actions tab → **CI** → **Run workflow** (tick `full_ci`)

```

The engine's own suites are not reproducible from this repo — run them in
`sempermechanics/semper-dic-engine`, or from the submodule as described in
[docs/engine/TESTING.md](../engine/TESTING.md).

## Manual release

A separate `workflow_dispatch` workflow ([release.yml](../../.github/workflows/release.yml))
builds a signed release APK and publishes it as a GitHub Release. Jobs only run
when the workflow is dispatched from **`main`**. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

Release builds **require** `SEMPER_API_BASE_URL` (repo or `release` environment
variable — see [ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md)) and pass
`-PrequireCloudApi=true` so an empty URL cannot silently ship with cloud sync
disabled. Local `assembleRelease` without that flag still allows offline
inspection builds. Release builds also pass `-PuploadCrashlyticsMapping=true`,
so the R8 mapping reaches Crashlytics; local builds never upload it.

## Backend deploy

[`deploy-backend.yml`](../../.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml) is
`workflow_dispatch` with separate **staging** and **production** GitHub
Environments. A **production** deploy runs only when dispatched from `main`
(the `deploy` job is skipped otherwise); staging may deploy a branch. It:

1. Runs the shared [`backend-gate`](../../.github/actions/backend-gate/action.yml),
   the same check Release and CI tier 4 run. It installs the hashed lock
   the image uses, runs `pip-audit`, ruff over `app/ tests/ scripts/ ../scripts/`,
   and pytest at the 93 % coverage floor.
2. Resolves the release train (TD-262): the `release_train` input, or, when it
   is empty, the newest `v*` tag reachable from the deployed commit (`git
   describe`; the job checks out full history, `fetch-depth: 0`), else
   `untagged`; lowercased, other characters turned into `-`, at most 63. Deploys
   from `backend/` tagging the new revision `cand-<run_id>-<run_attempt>` and
   labelling the service and the revision `release-train=<train>`.
   - **Existing service:** `no_traffic: true` — the previous revision keeps
     serving while the candidate is smoked.
   - **First create:** Cloud Run rejects `--no-traffic` on create, so the
     workflow sets `no_traffic: false` for that one deploy. The candidate is
     still smoked before you treat it as proven; prefer creating staging once,
     then always updating.
3. Smokes `GET /readyz` on the **tagged candidate URL**, authenticated with an ID
   token whose audience is the service URL — both environments run
   `--no-allow-unauthenticated` (staging too: the opposite flag binds
   `allUsers`), so an unauthenticated probe would only prove the
   gateway rejects it. The deploy SA needs `run.invoker` on each service.
4. Promotes the candidate to 100% traffic once the smoke passes (when
   `no_traffic` was used), with `--to-latest` after checking the latest ready
   revision is the candidate, and removes every `cand-*` tag in the same call.
5. Records the serving revision's image digest and its `release-train` label in
   the job summary. A label that does not match is a warning carrying the
   `gcloud run services update … --update-labels` command that sets it, not a
   rollback: this step runs after the promote.
6. Tags images by digest for the registry cleanup policy: `serving` on the
   promoted revision's image, `rollback-prev` on the image of the revision it
   replaced. A failure here is an error annotation, not a rollback; re-pin by
   hand ([BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md A7](../backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md#a7-storage-hygiene)).

7. The `gateway` job then moves that environment's API Gateway (`semper-gw`, or
   `semper-gw-staging` for staging) onto a config
   rendered from `backend/gateway/openapi.yaml`
   ([ADR-006](../adr/ADR-006-gateway-deploy-job.md)). Input `gateway_mode`
   defaults to `dry-run`, which prints the diff against the live config.
   `apply` creates the config, switches the gateway, checks `/v1/config` → 401
   and the consoles' preflight → 200 with the allowed origin, and switches back
   if either check fails.

On an update deploy, traffic never reaches an unproven revision, so a failed
smoke needs no rollback. The revision suffix includes the **run attempt** as
well as the run id, so re-running a failed job cannot collide with the revision
name the first attempt created.

Required secrets / vars (repo-level on Free private orgs is fine — Environment
*names* still select staging vs production in the workflow):
`GCP_WIF_PROVIDER`, `GCP_DEPLOY_SA`; vars `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`,
`SHARED_DRIVE_ID`, `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, `AUTO_APPROVE_HD`, `ADMIN_EMAILS`,
`SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `NOTIFY_FROM`, async provisioning `TASKS_QUEUE`,
`TASKS_LOCATION`, `TASKS_TARGET_BASE_URL` and `TASKS_INVOKER_SA`; optional
`NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM` (the new-device mail; unset keeps it off),
`CHECK_REVOKED_ON_STEP_UP`, `ENTITLEMENT_KID`, `ENTITLEMENT_OFFLINE_GRACE_DAYS`,
`MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION_CODE`, `RECOMMENDED_VERSION_CODE` (Semper's release gate),
their `_MATERIAL_TESTING` pair (this app's), `KILL_SWITCHES`
(space-separated) and `ENTITLEMENT_SIGNING_SECRET` (a Secret Manager secret name,
mounted as `ENTITLEMENT_SIGNING_KEY` only when it exists), all in
[ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md).

`REQUIRE_ATTESTED_UPLOADS` is no longer passed (retired 2026-09-26, TD-45):
`/uploads` is always device-attested. The "Describe live env" step warns while
a service still carries it; remove it after promote. See
[BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md](../backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md).

API Gateway OpenAPI uses the placeholders `__CLOUD_RUN_URL__`,
`__FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID__` and `__MANAGED_SERVICE__` — substitute all three at config-create time (see
`backend/gateway/openapi.yaml`). The substituted output goes to
`backend/gateway/openapi.generated.yaml`, which is **gitignored**: never commit a
live hostname or project id.

## Data-protection workflows

Two more scheduled workflows guard Firestore, both documented in
[FIRESTORE_DATA_PROTECTION.md](../backend/FIRESTORE_DATA_PROTECTION.md):

| Workflow | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`firestore-backup.yml`](../../.github/workflows/firestore-backup.yml) | Daily, 02:17 UTC | Exports Firestore to a GCS bucket, writing a `manifest.json` beside it. Refuses to run unless PITR is on |
| [`firestore-restore-drill.yml`](../../.github/workflows/firestore-restore-drill.yml) | Monthly, 03:40 UTC on the 1st, plus on demand | Imports the latest export into a throwaway project, verifies it against the manifest, then purges it. Runs in its own `restore-drill` GitHub environment |

Create the **`restore-drill`** environment before relying on the schedule — the
`production-backup` environment is not a substitute. See
[ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md).

## Caching

| Cache | Key pattern | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `app/.cxx` | `cxx-arm64-<hash>` (tier 5 + Release), `cxx-x86_64-<hash>` (tier 3) | ABI-specific CMake/ninja tree |
| `ccache` | `ccache-arm64-<hash>`, `ccache-x86_64-<hash>` | Compiled object cache, per ABI, keyed on native sources (not commit SHA) so Kotlin-only runs exact-hit |
| `~/.gradle` | managed by `setup-gradle`; `org.gradle.caching=true` | Dependency + task output cache |
| pip | managed by `setup-python` in `backend-gate`, keyed on `backend/requirements.lock` + `requirements-test.txt` | Backend dependencies |
| npm | managed by `setup-node` in `firestore-rules`, keyed on `firestore-rules-tests/package-lock.json` | Rules-test emulator and SDK |

### Shared steps

Local composite actions under `.github/actions/` hold the steps more than
one job runs:

| Action | Used by | What |
|--------|---------|------|
| `setup-android-build` | every app job | JDK 17 + Gradle; cache written from `main` only |
| `setup-native-ci` | tier 3, tier 5, Release, benchmark | `.cxx` / ccache restore, OpenCV sparse checkout, the `CCACHE_*` env |
| `enable-kvm` | tier 3, benchmark | Emulator acceleration |
| `check-arm64-so` | tier 5, Release | The release APK carries `libsemper_core.so` |
| `backend-gate` | tier 4, Release, Deploy | Lock install, audit, ruff, pytest + floor |
| `prune-cache` | tier 3, tier 5, Release | Drops superseded cache entries |

### Keeping under the 10 GB limit

A repository gets 10 GB of Actions cache. Each caching job prunes its own prefix
via [`.github/actions/prune-cache`](../../.github/actions/prune-cache/action.yml).
[`cache-cleanup.yml`](../../.github/workflows/cache-cleanup.yml) also drops a
PR's caches on close and runs a **weekly** sweep (plus on-demand) to delete
caches of deleted branches / closed PRs and trim LRU until usage is under 8 GB.

```bash
gh cache list --limit 100 --sort size_in_bytes --order desc
```

## Things that surprise people

**Only arm64-v8a is shipped.** Every phone from 2022 on is 64-bit ARM. CI builds
exactly what users get. Build for an emulator locally with `-PabiFilters=x86_64`.

**Wrapper validation is off in NDK jobs and in the Release workflow.** OpenCV's
repo bundles ancient `gradle-wrapper.jar` files that fail checksum validation,
and those jobs check out submodules recursively. Our own wrapper is validated by
tier 1 when tier 1 runs.

**A new push cancels a PR's older run, never `main`'s.** CI's concurrency
group is per branch, and `cancel-in-progress` is true only for `pull_request`
events. On `main` a started run finishes its full matrix. GitHub keeps one
pending run per group, so several merges while one run is in flight queue
only the newest; the ones in between get no run of their own. Before this,
merges cancelled each other: on 2026-09-26, 15 of 17 finished runs on `main`
were cancelled, and Tier 3 / 5 did not finish there for over an hour (TD-97).

**Three jobs run on every single event.** `secret-scan`, `legal-pages` and
`console-pages` carry no path filter, so a documentation-only PR still runs
them — and can still be blocked by them, which is the point.

**Runners are pinned to `ubuntu-24.04`, not `ubuntu-latest`.** GitHub moves
`ubuntu-latest` to Ubuntu 26 from 2026-10-19. The emulator, NDK / OpenCV and
Firestore-emulator jobs are sensitive to the image, so moving to 26 is its own
PR, run with `full_ci=true`, rather than a silent label change.

**Emulator steps pass `-no-metrics`.** Without an explicit metrics choice the
Android emulator prints an "ACTION REQUIRED" banner, which its own notes say a
future release turns into a blocking prompt. Keep the flag when editing
`emulator-options`.

**A green backend tier means more than pytest.** Tier 4 also audits dependencies
with pip-audit, proves `requirements.lock` resolves under `--require-hashes` on
Python 3.12, and checks that **versions** of every direct dep in
`requirements.txt` match the lock (not just package names). Deploy's `test` job
installs the lock the same way the image does.
