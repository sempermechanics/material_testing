# Tech debt

What is **owed** or **deliberately deferred**, and nothing else. A row is removed
when it is fixed or closed. Its history stays in git
(`git log -S'TD-NN' -- docs/ops/TECH_DEBT.md`), and what shipped is in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Forward-looking ideas are in
[FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md](FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md).

**Re-verified against the code on 2026-10-08** at `main` @ `070eb330`, and live
with `gcloud` and `gh` where a row is about deployed state. Evidence is
`path:line`, from `app/src/main/java/com/sempermechanics/semper/` unless it starts
at the repo root (or `backend/app/` for a `repo/`, `routers/` or other backend
module). On that date, the 81 rows that were fixed or closed were removed:
TD-3, 24–28, 33–35, 37–44, 46–64, 66–68, 70–77, 79–88, 90, 97, 133, 134, 136–138,
178–184, 186–193, 195 and 196. TD-65 followed the same day: the `steel_24` fixture
(→ `steel_26`, `steel_27`; subset 21, step 5) gave the same `.dat` SHA-256 four
times on one emulator. The line cites in TD-29, TD-45, TD-176, TD-198, TD-209 and
the gates below were re-checked on 2026-10-14 at `main` @ `8ba7081c`, after #428–#435
closed TD-139, 153, 154, 163, 164, 169, 170, 173, 197 and 208.

TD numbers are shared with material_testing; check both registers before taking
one ([FORK_SYNC.md](FORK_SYNC.md)). The next free in both is TD-317 (TD-316 taken 2026-10-22 here: the Firebase CLI's index deploy refused against the live indexes; TD-315 taken by material_testing, in its register only; TD-314 taken 2026-10-19 here: a test account's phone cannot be released on its own; TD-313 taken 2026-10-19 here: CI's instrumented tests do not call the backend with the CI test account; TD-312 taken 2026-10-19 here: the unit-test JVM that exits with no failing test; TD-311 taken 2026-10-19 by material_testing#140, in its register only: its `StaticAnalysisActivity.kt` at 510 lines; TD-306–TD-309 taken 2026-10-19 here by the follow-ups of #457's tech-debt batch, and TD-310 the same day by material_testing#140, in its register only: a beam tilted in the photo, closed there the same day; TD-281–TD-299 taken 2026-10-19 by the review fixes of #457, most closed the same day (below), the rest in the open register; TD-300–TD-305 the same day by material_testing#140, in its register only: its lab follow-ups and the sync of #457's UI fixes; TD-280 taken 2026-10-19 by
material_testing's sync of `5b59cf3`, in its register only: its lab tests lose their type and
loads on Re-run as a copy, closed there the same day; TD-279 taken 2026-10-18 by the follow-up review, closed 2026-10-19; TD-269, TD-270 and TD-276 closed 2026-10-19; TD-274–TD-278 taken 2026-10-18 by the account-anchored
entitlement decision, [ADR-024](../adr/ADR-024-account-anchored-entitlements.md); TD-270–TD-273 taken 2026-10-18 by the
follow-ups below; TD-214–TD-269 taken 2026-10-18 by the
readiness-framework cross-check, [PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md#framework-cross-check-2026-10-18);
TD-213 not used here; TD-212 taken 2026-10-17; TD-211 taken and closed
2026-10-15; material_testing's register holds TD-214–TD-269 too and nothing above them,
checked 2026-10-18). Its own open rows not listed
here are TD-135 and TD-139 (TD-145, fixed here, was closed there on 2026-10-19 on #140); TD-29,
TD-30, TD-36, TD-45 and TD-69 are open in both (checked against its `main` @
`12f2e7d` on 2026-10-08). TD-199 means two things: here it was the unit-test
heap, fixed by #350 except two holders, which were TD-200 and are fixed too;
there it was the files over 500 lines, closed by its #123.

**Closed 2026-10-18 on `claude/readiness-followups-jhfhj9`** (at `75bac5f`, on top of
#448; neither merged nor deployed), and removed from the register. The entry moves to
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) once it is merged and deployed. Cites are at `75bac5f`.
The Android rows are closed in code; their tests first run in the branch's first
Tier 1 (TD-219).

- **TD-239** (Auth Admin calls had no budget). `rate_limit.auth_admin_bucket`, one
  shared key per instance, `AUTH_ADMIN_CALLS_PER_SECOND` 10 and `AUTH_ADMIN_BURST` 20
  (`backend/app/config.py:259-260`, `backend/app/rate_limit.py:138-147`). Over it,
  `revoke_sessions` and `delete_auth_user` make no call and answer False
  (`backend/app/google_auth.py:96-101`, `:110`, `:125`); the step-up revocation check
  answers 503 `auth_check_busy` with `Retry-After`, logged `auth_admin_rate_limited`
  (`backend/app/deps.py:554-562`); a quota error from the Auth project is still a 401
  logged `revocation_check_failed` (`:571-576`). Tests `backend/tests/test_revocation.py:266-356`.
  The console has no sentence for the 503: TD-272.
- **TD-242** (addresses in audit rows). `audit.address_tag` / `address_tags`
  (`observability.short_hash`, `backend/app/audit.py:35-47`): an individual mint records
  `emailLockHash`; an institution mint, a convert and an `adminEmails` edit record
  `adminEmailHashes` and `adminEmailCount` (`backend/app/routers/admin.py:27-40`, `:234`,
  `:258`, `:342`, `:434`). Tests `backend/tests/test_audit_addresses.py`. The
  free-text `note` on `ADMIN_LICENSE_EXTEND` followed as TD-270, closed 2026-10-19.
- **TD-243** (erasure leftovers). `delete_all_user_data` deletes every `auth_links` row
  whose `uid` is the account and blanks `email` on every seat the account held, live or
  in a deleted licence's hold, revoking a live one first (`backend/app/repo/account.py:156-244`);
  the `ACCOUNT_DELETE` detail gains `authLinks`, `seatsBlanked` and `seatScanComplete`
  (`:241-243`, recorded at `backend/app/routers/account.py:363`). Tests
  `backend/tests/test_erasure_personal_data.py`. The seat search needs a new index
  deployed before the backend: TD-271.
- **TD-244** (an address in the search URL). `POST /v1/admin/licenses/search` takes
  `{q, limit, page_token, include_demo, include_revoked}` (`AdminLicenseSearch`,
  `backend/app/models.py:446-460`; an extra field is 422) at `admin`, on `admin_bucket`,
  and answers as the GET does (`backend/app/routers/admin.py:166-174`); its gateway path
  is declared before `/{licenseId}` (`backend/gateway/openapi.yaml:626-644`, pinned by
  `backend/tests/test_gateway_parity.py`); the desk searches with it
  (`firebase-hosting/public/console/operator/licences.js:157`). The GET still answers
  `q` for one release and logs `deprecated_query_search` without the value
  (`admin.py:159-161`). Tests `backend/tests/test_licence_search_post.py`. Retiring the
  GET's `q`: TD-273.
- **TD-245** (licensing events without uid). The handler passes `uid` to `activation`
  and `checkout` (`backend/app/routers/licenses.py:19-31`, `:62-64`, `:98-100`), and
  `_devlock_drop` passes the user's (`backend/app/repo/devlock.py:295`). Tests
  `backend/tests/test_release_gate_and_events.py:161`, `:175`, `:197`.
- **TD-254** (seats without `schemaVersion`). Every seat write stamps it: claim
  (`backend/app/repo/claims.py:224`, `:253`), roster (`repo/seats.py:215`, `:245`,
  `:297`, `:359`), lease (`repo/leases.py:99`, `:172`, `:216`), licence edits
  (`repo/license_admin.py:152`, `:335`), device lock (`repo/devlock.py:150`), restore
  (`repo/deletion.py:204`) and erasure (`repo/account.py:202`). Tests
  `backend/tests/test_seat_schema_version.py`.
- **TD-260** (`setHostedDomainFilter` never compiled). Compiled and tested in CI run
  39158239853 on `ae4c24a` (#448's head): Tier 1, Tier 3, Tier 4, Tier 5 and the rules
  job passed; material_testing#137 passed Tier 1 and Tier 5 in its run 39156925646. The
  EMM field test is TD-257.
- **TD-262** (no release train on backend deploys). `deploy-backend.yml` input
  `release_train` (`.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml:39-47`); empty, the newest `v*`
  tag reachable from the deployed commit (`git describe`, with `fetch-depth: 0` at
  `:93`), else `untagged`; lowercased, other characters to `-`, at most 63
  (`:136-156`). Set as the Cloud Run label `release-train` on the service and the new
  revision (`:300-301`); a revision without it after promote is a warning, not a
  rollback (`:425-442`). Proven by the first deploy from the branch.
- **TD-263** (screens showed the server's cap). `LicenseEntitlements.shownAnalysisCap`
  (`data/account/LicenseEntitlements.kt:224`), through `EntitlementPolicy.shownCap`
  (`data/account/entitlement/EntitlementPolicy.kt:116`), is what Home's quota card and
  the session-limit screen show (`ui/home/HomeQuotaCard.kt:73`;
  `ui/limit/SessionLimitActivity.kt:63`, `:74`). Tests `EntitlementPolicyTest`,
  `LicenseEntitlementsTest`.
- **TD-264** (`refreshAfter` unread). A unique one-off `license-config-now`
  (`WorkTags.LICENSE_CONFIG_NOW_NAME`, `data/cloud/WorkTags.kt:71`): `/v1/config` only,
  expedited, `KEEP`, retried with backoff up to `EntitlementRefresh.MAX_ATTEMPTS` (6,
  about 15 minutes; `data/account/entitlement/EntitlementRefresh.kt:48`, `:89`)
  (`LicenseConfigWorker.refreshNow`, `data/LicenseConfigWorker.kt:106-117`). Queued at
  launch and on each return to the foreground when the token is past `refreshAfter` or
  lapsed (`refreshNowIfDue`, `:121-126`, through the `AppForeground` listener
  `foregroundCheck`, `:134-139`, installed at `SemperApp.kt:47-51`; it was
  `installForegroundCheck` until #457 merged the app's three foreground counts into
  `data/AppForeground.kt`).
  Tests `EntitlementRefreshTest`, `LicenseConfigWorkerTest`.
- **TD-265** (non-malicious events read as tampering). `SealedRecordStore`
  (`data/account/entitlement/SealedRecordStore.kt`) orders the writes, and
  `EntitlementPolicy.reading` (`EntitlementPolicy.kt:137-144`) reads them: a first seal
  marks itself durably, makes the key, then writes the record and clears the mark in one
  `commit()`; a clear deletes the key before the record. A record with no key (a lost
  Keystore key, a clear cut short) and a key with the mark but no record (a crash
  mid-seal) read as no token and are tidied; only a key with neither record nor mark, or
  a MAC that does not match, reads as tampered. Every write is `commit()`
  (`EntitlementStore.kt:207-225`). Tests `SealedRecordStoreTest`, `EntitlementPolicyTest`.
  It widens TD-261: deleting the key alone now also reads as no token.
- **TD-266** (floating refresh after a heartbeat). After a checkout or heartbeat, a failed
  `/v1/config` fetch queues the one-off refresh above
  (`SeatLease.refreshConfigAfterCheckout`, `data/account/SeatLease.kt:79-87`; from
  `heartbeatBestEffort`, `:68`, and the seat screen, `ui/limit/SeatRequiredActivity.kt:76`).
  A floating token past `graceUntil` or `exp` now opens the seat screen rather than
  demo's limits (`EntitlementPolicy.seatRequired`, `EntitlementPolicy.kt:126-129`;
  `LicenseEntitlements.isSeatRequiredToStart`, `LicenseEntitlements.kt:133-135`). Tests
  `SeatLeaseTest`, `EntitlementPolicyTest`, `LicenseEntitlementsTest`.
- **TD-267** (exported addresses did not import back). `roster_io.undefused` drops the
  one `'` the export adds before a formula lead (`backend/app/roster_io.py:112-120`,
  used at `:88`). Tests `backend/tests/test_roster_bulk.py:338`, `:546`, `:550`.
- **TD-268** (Update opened Play for a sideloaded build). `UpdateSource.urls`
  (`ui/limit/UpdateSource.kt:28-36`): a build Play installed opens its listing; any other
  opens `https://github.com/sempermechanics/semperdic-app/releases`, chosen from
  `getInstallSourceInfo` (`UpdateRequiredActivity.openStore`,
  `ui/limit/UpdateRequiredActivity.kt:49-58`); Home's banner goes through it
  (`ui/home/HomeActivity.kt:379`). The repository is public (GitHub REST API, checked
  2026-10-18), so the page needs no GitHub account. Tests `UpdateSourceTest`,
  `UpdateRequiredActivityTest`. In-app updates stay TD-233.

**Closed 2026-10-18 on the same branch at `2371bec`** by the account-anchored
entitlement change ([ADR-024](../adr/ADR-024-account-anchored-entitlements.md)), and
removed from the register. Cites are at `2371bec`.

- **TD-259** (`enrollmentInvite` parsed and never read; `activateLicense` with no
  caller). Superseded by ADR-024: entitlements attach to the account, and nothing is
  entered in the app. The key leaves `app/src/main/res/xml/app_restrictions.xml`
  (now `accountEmailDomain`, `cloudBackupAllowed`, `backupOnUnmeteredOnly`) and
  `ManagedConfig` (ffc41b7); the key screen the branch had added (c748630, never
  released) leaves with `ui/account/`, `CloudApi`/`SemperApi.activateLicense` and
  `LicenseActivateRequest` (e084f39). A one-time code is redeemed on the web account
  page instead (`POST /v1/me/claim`, `backend/app/routers/licenses.py:195-256`;
  `firebase-hosting/public/console/account/claim.js`). Tests
  `backend/tests/test_claim_code.py`, `firebase-hosting/tests/account-claim.test.mjs`,
  `PolicyTest`. The EMM field test stays TD-257; the legacy route's fixture is TD-278.
- **TD-272** (no console sentence for `auth_check_busy`). `COMMON.auth_check_busy`
  (`firebase-hosting/public/console/messages.js:18`, "The server is busy checking
  sign-ins — wait a few seconds and try again."), added by 581a530, which also routes
  the operator desk's step-up writes (revoke, unbind, approve, withdraw invite) through
  `explain()`; the claim card relies on the same sentence
  (`firebase-hosting/public/console/account/claim.js:24-26`). `api()` still does not
  wait and retry; the tests pin that it neither steps up, signs out nor resends
  (`firebase-hosting/tests/auth.test.mjs:135-140`; `operator.test.mjs:413`;
  `account-claim.test.mjs:239`).

**Closed 2026-10-19 on `claude/new-session-jhfhj9`** (after #448 and #449 merged), and
removed from the register.

- **TD-270** (a licence edit's free-text `note` kept as typed in `audit_logs`).
  `_audited_patch` records `noteChanged` and `noteLength`, never the text
  (`backend/app/routers/admin.py:34-45`). Test
  `test_a_note_edit_records_its_length_not_its_text` (`backend/tests/test_audit_addresses.py`).
- **TD-276** (a phone released by staff still counted its previous holder's analyses
  toward the next holder's demo cap). `forget_device_sessions` drops `deviceId` from
  the account's sessions created from the released phones
  (`backend/app/repo/devices.py:82-107`); the staff release calls it
  (`backend/app/routers/admin.py:118-126`, audited as `sessionsForgotten`), and so does
  a staff or IT licence lock clear (`backend/app/repo/seats.py:224-229`). The holder's own
  clear does not: a second account on the same phone could otherwise shed the first
  one's count. The analyses stay the account's and still count toward its own cap.
  Tests `test_after_a_staff_release_the_next_holder_is_not_held_by_the_last`
  (`backend/tests/test_demo_device_cap.py`), `test_a_staff_clear_stops_the_old_phone_counting_the_holders_analyses`
  and `test_the_holders_own_clear_keeps_the_phone_counting`
  (`backend/tests/test_device_binding_per_app.py`); the query's shape is declared in
  `backend/tests/test_firestore_query_indexes.py`.
- **TD-269** (a secret the runtime SA cannot read stopped every deploy at the candidate's
  start). `scripts/check_secret_access.sh` reads the secret's and then the project's IAM
  policy and fails, naming the `add-iam-policy-binding` to run, when neither grants an
  access role to the runtime SA; an unreadable policy is a warning. `deploy-backend.yml`
  runs it before mounting `ENTITLEMENT_SIGNING_KEY` (`.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml:258-291`).
  Tests against the stub `gcloud` in `backend/tests/test_script_ops_gcp.py`.

**Closed 2026-10-19 on `claude/readiness-followups-jhfhj9`**, and removed from the
register.

- **TD-279** (the device half of the demo cap answered the account's 409, so the
  limit screen's Re-check lifted a stop the next upload refused). The device half now
  answers its own `409 device_quota_exceeded` (`backend/app/errors.py:53`, in
  `CLIENT_BRANCHED` at `:278`; `backend/app/routers/sessions.py:499`), which the app
  classifies as a quota failure (`data/cloud/UploadErrors.kt:73`) and holds as its own
  stop (`data/UploadFailures.kt:161`; `AccountCache.setDeviceLimitReached`,
  `data/net/AccountCache.kt:150`). `setQuota`, which Re-check calls, does not lift it;
  a delete on the phone (`:136`), sign-out or a licence does (`SessionQuota.deviceStop`,
  read only while the server counts the account as demo). The limit screen says the
  phone is full and hides the account's counter (`ui/limit/SessionLimitActivity.kt:57-64`,
  `limit_body_device`). A delete, not an upload's success, lifts the stop: while it
  holds no new analysis starts, so the only uploads are of sessions already admitted.
  A build without the code fails that one backup as refused (`Kind.REJECTED`) rather
  than showing the limit screen. Tests `backend/tests/test_demo_device_cap.py`
  (`test_another_accounts_analyses_on_this_device_fill_the_demo_cap`),
  `QuotaGateTest`, `DicUploadWorkerTest`, `UploadErrorsTest`,
  `SessionLimitDeviceStopTest`.

**Closed 2026-10-19 on `ccr-603fe346-1bw2fa`** (#457, open; neither merged nor
deployed), and removed from the register. The entry moves to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
once it is merged and deployed. Cites are at `0b364d6`; the commits are in
`git log 448cceb..0b364d6`. The Android rows' tests first run in the branch's next Tier 1;
the benchmarks and device checks the rows asked for are not run yet. TD-198 and TD-294
were done in part (their rows say what), and TD-210 was looked at and left for a decision.

- **TD-306** (a refused consent change stayed on the phone). `AuthRepository.setImprovementConsent` stores the answer only after the server accepts it (`data/account/AuthRepository.kt:335-352`, cache write `:347`); signed out it stays local. The Terms gate still saves the first choice before sending, and the next status check overwrites it (`AccessStatusResolver.kt:163`). Tests: `AuthRepositoryTest.kt:389-418`, `ui/settings/SettingsRotationTest.kt:175`. Commit `d87e69a`.
- **TD-307** (a retried restore started from byte 0). `RestoreBundleFetcher.downloadAndUnpackBundle` keeps the `.part` for a `DownloadFailure.Transient` (`data/cloud/restore/RestoreBundleFetcher.kt:112-136`); size, zip or sha256 failures and every give-up discard it, and `DicRestoreWorker.onFailure` drops a kept part on give-up (`data/DicRestoreWorker.kt:117`). Tests: `RestoreWorkersTest.kt:424`, `:449`, `:461`. Commit `4cc360d`.

- **TD-281** (a pending upload carried no hash). `upload_target` answers the declared
  `sha256` (`backend/app/repo/sessions.py:157-169`, `:168`), `PendingUploadDto.sha256` is
  nullable (`data/net/ApiDtos.kt:251-264`, `:263`), and `UploadSessionPlanner.matchPending`
  pairs a pending upload with a staged file only when the hashes agree as well as role,
  name and size (`data/UploadSessionPlanner.kt:385-391`); an older backend that sends none
  keeps the size match. Contract fixtures `contracts/session_create_response.json`,
  `contracts/session_uploads_response.json`. Tests: `DicUploadWorkerTest` (same sizes,
  other bytes under a live session, `:85`),
  `test_a_pending_upload_carries_the_hash_its_file_was_declared_with`
  (`backend/tests/test_async_provisioning.py:251`). `7459cb2`.
- **TD-282** (the staging bound to its session only in memory). A sidecar,
  `upload_staging/.declared` (`StagingBinding`, `data/StagingBinding.kt:29`;
  `declares`, `:37-41`; `SessionLayout.kt:106`, `:134`), names the cloud session and the
  sha256 declared for each staged file; `createSession` writes it right after the pointer
  (`data/UploadSessionPlanner.kt:256-260`). `UploadStaging.prepare` reuses a finished
  staging under a pointer only when the binding names that session and the hashes still
  match (`data/UploadStaging.kt:81-89`); otherwise the session is released
  (`releaseForRestage`, `data/DicUploadWorker.kt:165`) and the files declared afresh. The
  staged bytes are untouched. Tests `DicUploadWorkerRestageTest` (`:102`, `:116`, `:131`,
  `:144`). `2b0e714`.
- **TD-283** (a stopped restore lost its bundle `.part`). The row's premise was half
  right: the `.part` was dropped by the fetcher itself, whose `finally` ran `discard` on a
  cancel too, not only by the worker's `clearPartialArtifacts`. Now
  `RestoreBundleFetcher.downloadAndUnpackBundle` keeps it when the attempt is cancelled
  (`data/cloud/restore/RestoreBundleFetcher.kt:103-123`, `:117-121`), and
  `DicRestoreWorker`'s cancel path goes through `clearStoppedRestore`
  (`data/DicRestoreWorker.kt:99-100`, `:180-184`): the session dir is reset, and the
  download dropped (`CloudRestore.discardDownloads`, `data/cloud/restore/CloudRestore.kt:353`)
  only when `keepsDestinationOnStop` (`data/DicBundleDownloadWorker.kt:259`) says nothing
  reruns it. Tests `RestoreWorkersTest` (`:333`, `:369`, `:381`, `:393`). A transient
  failure still restarts from byte 0: TD-307. `7628767`.
- **TD-284** (`index.json` parsed two or three times per change). `SessionStore` keeps the
  rows it last parsed or wrote, keyed by the primary's path, length and modified time
  (`ParsedIndex`, `data/session/SessionStore.kt:60`, `:67`; read through `:340-347`);
  `write` knows the primary it promotes parsed (`:428`) and records what it wrote (`:438`);
  `ignoreUnknownKeys` stays (`:43`). Tests `SessionStoreParseOnceTest`. `aab2753`.
- **TD-285** (a batch run that threw after its commit was not undone). The steps after
  `session.commit()` (`ui/analysis/run/BatchAnalysis.kt:320`) run in a try of their own
  (`:335-369`) whose catch undoes the run with the commit known (`undoCommittedBatch`,
  `ui/analysis/run/CancelledRun.kt:112`): the committed results go (`RunSession.dropResults`,
  `ui/analysis/wizard/RunChannels.kt:341`, also `commit`'s first step, `:328-329`), each
  moved frame goes back or the wizard is pointed where it stayed, and the failure goes on up.
  The JNI loop is untouched. Test `CancelDiscardsRunTest` (`:230`). `9e67b3f`.
- **TD-286** (the wizard had no state type). `WizardInputs`
  (`ui/analysis/wizard/WizardInputs.kt:49`) in one `StateFlow` (`AnalysisViewModel.inputs`,
  `ui/analysis/wizard/AnalysisViewModel.kt:63`, `:70`; `edit`, `:77`); `WizardState.save`
  reads the one value and `restoreScalars` restores it in one edit
  (`ui/analysis/wizard/WizardState.kt:88-91`, `:122-125`), Bundle keys unchanged
  (`WizardStateBundleFormatTest` untouched). `SweepSetupController` is built first in
  `buildPages` (`ui/analysis/StaticAnalysisActivity.kt:155`), so the four `isInitialized`
  guards are gone and `AnalysisReadyGate.apply` takes it non-null
  (`ui/analysis/wizard/AnalysisReadyGate.kt:29`). Tests `AnalysisViewModelTest`. Left: the
  properties stay as views over `inputs`, and `sweepController` is still `lateinit`: TD-308.
  `017e35a`.
- **TD-287** (viewer classes took the Activity whole). Each takes its own host
  interface: `FrameLoaderHost` (`ui/viewer/ViewerFrameLoader.kt:21`), `ImageHost`
  (`ViewerImageLoader.kt:19`), `ScaleHost` (`ViewerScaleController.kt:26`), `FrameJumpHost`
  (`FrameJumpController.kt:16`), `CaptionsHost` (`ViewerCaptions.kt:19`), `FieldPopupHost`
  (`FieldPopup.kt:13`), `ShareControllerHost` (`ViewerShareController.kt:22`), `ViewerViews`
  (`ViewerChromeController.kt:12`), `SummaryHost`
  (`ui/viewer/summary/ViewerSummaryController.kt:41`), `InspectHost`
  (`ui/viewer/inspect/ViewerInspectController.kt:17`) and `ShareSource`
  (`ui/viewer/share/ShareCenter.kt:230`); the Activity implements them
  (`ui/viewer/ResultViewerActivity.kt:65`) and its forwarders are gone. `prefetchAround`
  keeps its body whole (`ui/viewer/ViewerFrameLoader.kt:142`). `SettingsUsedSheet` still
  takes the Activity (`ui/viewer/SettingsUsedSheet.kt:101`); it was not one of the twelve.
  Tests `ViewerRotationTest`, `ViewerControllersTest`, `ShareCenterTest`;
  `ViewerScrubBenchmark` not run yet. `0f33aa4`, `de73ed2`.
- **TD-288** (value ranges as `Pair` in the batch path). `ValueRange` throughout: the run's
  per-frame ranges (`ui/analysis/run/BatchAnalysis.kt:159`), `FieldRangesStore.write` /
  `writeBestEffort` / `read` (`report/FieldRangesStore.kt:54`, `:78`, `:92`),
  `VisualizationEngine.valueRanges` (`report/VisualizationEngine.kt:92`, `:101`) and
  `HeatmapColorScale` (`report/HeatmapColorScale.kt:41`, `:145`, `:166`); the sidecar's bytes
  are unchanged. `ValueRange.toPair` and `of(pair)` are deleted (`field/ValueRange.kt`).
  Tests `FieldRangesStoreTest`, `SummaryGifOracleTest`, `VisualizationEngineTest`. `e0ae47c`.
- **TD-289** (`SummaryAnimation.FIELDS`). Deleted; the bundler's GIF loop walks
  `FieldKind.entries` (`data/cloud/SessionUploadBundler.kt:245`), same order and names,
  as does the benchmark seeder (`app/src/benchmark/java/com/sempermechanics/semper/benchmark/BenchmarkSeedActivity.kt:91`, missed
  by `56ee4c0` and caught by Kover's benchmark-variant compile).
  Test `SummaryAnimationTest`. `56ee4c0`; the seeder `d2cf815`.
- **TD-290** (`HomeActivity.kt` 434 lines). Its cloud check moved to `HomeCloudCheck`
  (`ui/home/HomeCloudCheck.kt:21`, `request` `:50`; built at `ui/home/HomeActivity.kt:108`),
  a pure move: 386 lines at `195e8b1`, 388 at `0b364d6`. `195e8b1`.
- **TD-291** (ADR-016 rule 1 checked only in review). Built as a source check rather than
  the lint module the row proposed ([ADR-016](../adr/ADR-016-work-that-outlives-the-activity.md#amendments),
  2026-10-19): `scripts/check_activity_scope_work.py` flags a network call or an enqueue
  reached from a screen's `lifecycleScope`, with the triaged exceptions and their reasons in
  `scripts/activity_scope_allowlist.txt` (eight: three repeated refreshes, four enqueues a
  cancel cannot lose, one false positive; a stale entry fails). CI step "No user work on a
  screen's lifecycleScope" (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:120-121`); tests
  `scripts/tests/test_check_activity_scope_work.py` over `scripts/tests/fixtures/`. Every
  violation it found was fixed, none allowlisted: Settings' restore, consent, exports and
  phone-only erase (`ui/settings/SettingsViewModel.kt`), the seat request
  (`ui/limit/SeatRequiredViewModel.kt`), Terms (`ui/auth/TermsViewModel.kt`), Admin
  (`ui/admin/AdminViewModel.kt`), the analysis limit's Re-check and Refresh
  (`ui/limit/SessionLimitViewModel.kt`) and Home's multi-row erase
  (`HomeViewModel.eraseLocally`, `ui/home/HomeViewModel.kt:165`). Tests
  `SettingsRotationTest`, `SeatRequiredRotationTest`, `AdminRotationTest`,
  `SessionLimitRotationTest`, `HomeEraseRotationTest`. `5c3d30b`, `e05d8d5`, `0b364d6`;
  the ViewModels `895e4a0`, `cf234b3`, `81dbb6d`, `1097d4a`, `a7b09b6`, `ba9c9c6`.
- **TD-292** (nothing checked ADR-015's ~500 lines). `scripts/check_kotlin_file_size.py`
  fails a main Kotlin file over 500 lines, the hot-loop functions ADR-015 exempts not
  counted (`HOT_LOOPS`); CI step "Main Kotlin files within ADR-015's size budget"
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:113-114`); tests `scripts/tests/test_check_kotlin_file_size.py`.
  One file was allowlisted at its size, `data/cloud/SessionMetadataDoc.kt` 506
  (`scripts/kotlin_file_size_allowlist.txt`, may only shrink). Split later the same day, a
  pure move under ADR-015's rule: its ten field serializers are top-level `internal object`s
  of the same names in `data/cloud/SessionMetadataSerializers.kt` (`:22-40`, at `9aa8cd1`),
  so every `@Serializable(with = …)` resolves unchanged and the JSON is the same, no test
  or fixture changed. `SessionMetadataDoc.kt` is 482 lines and the allowlist holds no entry
  (`check_kotlin_file_size.py`: "0 allowlisted"). `e7bbb6b`; the split `b85e0a5`.
- **TD-293** (orchestration in routers, step-up tiers in `deps.py`). The tiers are in
  `backend/app/step_up.py` (`_step_up` `:55`, `step_up_check` `:117`, `_require_not_revoked`
  `:180`), and the multi-step flows in `backend/app/services/`: account erasure and export
  (`services/account.py`, `erase_account` `:104`, called at `backend/app/routers/account.py:263`),
  recording an analysis and the bundle stream (`services/sessions.py`, `record_session` `:142`,
  `bundle_stream` `:277`) and the licence mint (`services/licenses.py`, `mint_license` `:72`).
  `deps.py` is 490 lines. `backend/tests/test_layering.py` pins no router function over 40
  lines of code (`:28`), `deps.py` under 500 (`:40`) and the import direction (`:44`, `:59`).
  `cc72a7c`.
- **TD-295** (a new device told its holder nothing). `notify.device_registered`
  (`backend/app/notify.py:222-250`, de-duplicated on `device-registered:<uid>:<device>`,
  `:249`), called after the registration commits for a new device only, to the verified
  address (`backend/app/routers/devices.py:55-57`). Its own sender, `NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM`
  (`backend/app/config.py:334`); unset, the mail is off. Tests
  `backend/tests/test_device_registered_mail.py:33`, `:53`;
  `backend/tests/test_notify.py:158`, `:170`, `:179`. To turn it on: TD-309. `b8165fc`.
- **TD-296** (a late provisioning retry left a delete unguarded). `provision_session` reads
  a retried session through `repo.start_provisioning` (`backend/app/session_provision.py:77`),
  which stamps `updatedAt` in the same transaction as the read, only while it is still
  PROVISIONING (`backend/app/repo/sessions.py:228-251`); a delete that lands first wins.
  Tests `backend/tests/test_async_provisioning.py:673`, `:708`, `:722`. `dbf7483`.
- **TD-297** (a seat kept its claim-time address). `_touch_existing`, when it writes a new
  email from a verified token, updates the seat on the account's current institution
  licence (`_refresh_seat_address`, `backend/app/repo/users.py:209`, `:213-231`): one write,
  no query; an unverified address is not copied. Tests
  `backend/tests/test_firestore_repo.py:424`, `:436`. `f077a3c`.

**Closed later on 2026-10-19 on the same branch** (#457, open; neither merged nor
deployed), and removed from the register. Cites are at `9aa8cd1`; the commits are in
`git log 077b3f4..9aa8cd1`. The Android rows' tests first run in the branch's next Tier 1,
and the device test TD-207 names is not run yet. TD-237, TD-246 and TD-294 were done in
part (their rows say what); TD-289's and TD-292's entries above gain a commit each.

- **TD-171** (detekt never checked cancellation handling). Built as a source check, as
  TD-291 was, not as detekt's rule: `scripts/check_swallowed_cancellation.py` flags a broad
  `catch` (`Exception`, `Throwable`, `RuntimeException`, `IllegalStateException`) or a
  `runCatching` in `app/src/main` whose block calls a suspend function, unless a
  `CancellationException` clause comes first, the catch rethrows or calls
  `rethrowIfCallerCancelled()` / `ensureActive()`, the chain calls `getOrThrow()`, or it
  runs under `NonCancellable` ([ADR-018](../adr/ADR-018-error-convention.md)). Suspend
  calls are known by name (`suspend_names`, `:126`; `in_suspend_context`, `:154`), so it
  needs no type resolution. `scripts/swallowed_cancellation_allowlist.txt` holds no entry
  (triaged 2026-10-19; a stale entry fails). CI step "No swallowed coroutine cancellation
  (ADR-018)" (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:128-129`); tests
  `scripts/tests/test_check_swallowed_cancellation.py` over
  `scripts/tests/fixtures/cancellation/`. The tree passes (451 files); the commit records
  that turning the 19 `suspendRunCatching` calls back into `runCatching` flags all 19, and
  stripping the rethrows from 32 handled catches flags 29. detekt's
  `SuspendFunSwallowedCancellation` stays an option once detekt 2.x is taken (TD-69).
  `3e75188`.
- **TD-198** (the 2026-10-05 perf pass's small items; the fourth closed earlier,
  `8142208`). `list_user_sessions` selects only `LISTED_SESSION_FIELDS`
  (`backend/app/repo/sessions.py:315`, the query `:361`), for the whole account and the
  per-app scan. Reconcile selects `SEAT_FIELDS` from the roster and reads the holders with
  `get_all(field_paths=HOLDER_FIELDS)` (`backend/app/repo/reconcile.py:54-55`, `:116`,
  `:127`; `_get_all`, `backend/app/repo/_base.py:350`); a holder with none of those fields
  reads as `{}`, still an account. `_search_licenses` runs its lookups at once on a per-call
  thread pool and merges them in their order (`backend/app/repo/license_admin.py:91`,
  `:104-107`). The access log takes the template FastAPI matched (`routed_template`,
  `backend/app/observability.py:116`; `classify_route(…, template)`, `:138`; called at
  `backend/app/main.py:215`), `route_template` (`:103`) only as the fallback.
  `tests/fake_firestore.py` honours `select()` and `get_all(field_paths=…)` (`:116`, `:264`,
  `:426`). Tests `backend/tests/test_read_projections.py` (`:54`, `:86`, `:113`, `:144`,
  `:170`, `:180`). `9a204e3`.
- **TD-207** (retriever-rung frames timed by the time asked for). `RetrieverFrameClock`
  (`imaging/video/RetrieverFrameClock.kt:21`) walks the video track's samples with a
  `MediaExtractor` of its own (`read`, `:54`; `walk`, `:89`), from the sync frame before the
  segment through the first sync frame after it and the frames that show before it, and
  times each frame as the platform picks it: the nearest sample for `OPTION_CLOSEST`, the
  nearest sync sample for `OPTION_CLOSEST_SYNC`, the later on a tie (`frameTimeUs`,
  `:27-28`; `nearest`, `:106`). The retriever rung reads the clock once
  (`imaging/video/VideoFrameExtractor.kt:264`) and records each frame's time from it
  (`:289`); `getFrame` says which option returned the frame (`:314`, `RetrievedFrame`
  `:324`). A clip the extractor will not open keeps the time asked for
  (`RetrieverFrameClock.NONE`, `:37`); the hardware and AVI rungs are unchanged. Tests
  `RetrieverFrameClockTest` (`:20`, `:32`, `:46`, `:60`, `:68`). The clock models how
  `getFrameAtTime` chooses a frame; that a device's retriever chooses the same way is
  checked only by `VideoFrameExtractionDeviceTest`
  (`fixedIntervalOnTheRetrieverRungTimesEachFrameByItsOwnTime`, `:113`, and the key-frame
  case, `:108`), which is the real check and has not run yet. `27ebd94`.
- **TD-308** (TD-286's remainder). The 36 forwarding properties are deleted: every reader
  takes `inputs.value` and every writer makes one `edit { }` per change
  (`ui/analysis/wizard/AnalysisViewModel.kt:64`; `edit`, `:74-84`), so a change of several
  fields (a new reference, a frame import or video extract, a re-run, the sweep's ranges,
  the frame order, the draft restore and reset) is one emission. The draft mirror of a new
  reference or mask moved into `edit` (`:82-83`), and the subset recommendation snapshots
  its inputs on Main. The one `var` left is `cancelRequested` (`:182`); the file is 209 lines
  (459 at `077b3f4`). `sweepController` is `by lazy` (`ui/analysis/StaticAnalysisActivity.kt:104-106`),
  built by its first caller and a no-op until `setup()` (`:175`) finds its views, so no read
  throws. Bundle keys unchanged (`WizardStateBundleFormatTest` untouched). Tests
  `AnalysisViewModelTest` (`:300`, `:323`), `WizardStateTest`, `RerunInputsTest`,
  `SweepSetupControllerTest`; on a device `WizardDraftRestoreTest` and
  `EnginePipelineSmokeTest`. `7702e7f`, `9e19fd3`.

## Lint and detekt

Baselines stay empty: `app/lint-baseline.xml` and `app/detekt-baseline.xml`.
`./gradlew :app:lintDebug` fails on errors.

**Open warnings** (do not baseline, do not `warningsAsErrors` until decided):

- `OldTargetApi`: disabled in `app/build.gradle.kts:349` until a deliberate
  `targetSdk` 36→37 bump PR. Do not re-enable casually.

Size and complexity findings are silenced with targeted `@file:Suppress`, not a
baseline. Prefer extracting over widening those lists. On 2026-10-08, 58 main
files carry `@file:Suppress`: most often `MagicNumber` 25, `ReturnCount` 20,
`TooManyFunctions` 19, `LongParameterList` 12, `TooGenericExceptionCaught` 9,
`NestedBlockDepth` 6, `CyclomaticComplexMethod` 6 and `LongMethod` 5. Another 8
carry `@file:SuppressLint`. Since the baselines are empty, suppression is the only
thing keeping those findings quiet. Catalog version-availability lint IDs are
disabled; bump dependencies in deliberate PRs.

## Open register

Priority = (Impact + Risk) × (6 − Effort).

| ID | Category | Item | I | R | E | P | Status |
|----|----------|------|---|---|---|---|--------|
| TD-29 | App | Two auth continue hosts (`AUTH_HOST` / `LEGACY_AUTH_HOST`, `data/account/AuthLinks.kt:25,32`, both in `AUTH_HOSTS` at `:40`; four `autoVerify` App Link filters over two hosts in the manifest, `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:97`, `:108` for `app.sempermechanics.com` and `:122`, `:131` for the `firebaseapp.com` host; `AuthHostsTest.kt:17` pins the legacy host). The Firebase Console's password-reset custom action URL is still on `LEGACY_AUTH_HOST` (`…firebaseapp.com/finishReset`; [PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md), "Password-reset custom action URL"), so the legacy filters still carry every reset link | 1 | 2 | 2 | **8** | Deferred until Play vitals show no legacy-only build installed; then switch the reset URL to `AUTH_HOST` first and drop the legacy filters after (the reset URL reported 2026-10-19 by #457's agents; a Console setting, not re-checked from here) |
| TD-30 | Ops | API Gateway in asia-northeast1 (`semper-gw`, `semper-gw-staging`) vs Cloud Run in asia-south1 (`semper-api`, `semper-api-staging`), checked live 2026-10-08. The legacy gateway and API resources are gone; the `indic-gw@` and `indic-api@` service accounts are not, and still run both (`deploy-backend.yml:576`) | 2 | 1 | 3 | **9** | **Accepted** (checked 2026-09-24). The legacy pair is gone: `gcloud api-gateway apis list` shows only `semper-api` and `semper-api-staging`, `gcloud run services list` only `semper-api` and `semper-api-staging`, and `gcloud endpoints services list` has no `indic-api` service. API Gateway offers no asia-south1 location (its locations API lists asia-northeast1 as the only Asian region), so the gateway cannot move next to Cloud Run. Measured over 14 days (`serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_latencies_*`, service `semper-api`): gateway overhead p50 135 ms / p95 1.0 s, backend p50 0.71 s / p95 1.7 s, where backend includes the Tokyo→Mumbai leg. Removing the hop means replacing API Gateway, which needs an ADR, not a fix. **2026-09-26 (cost review):** kept, because the gateway costs nothing at 1,492 calls in 30 days. Production now scales to zero, so a cold start (p50 3.9 s, p95 6.0 s) matters more than this hop. Two options are deferred until a latency complaint or a public launch: (a) new builds call Cloud Run directly, and the gateway is retired once its traffic is about zero; (b) a global HTTPS load balancer with a serverless NEG, about $20–25 a month. Both need an app release ([perf/backend-cost.md](../perf/backend-cost.md)) |
| TD-36 | Legal | 10 bracketed operator fields in `docs/legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md` (:5 ×2, :7 ×2, :18, :153) and `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md` (:6 ×2, :438, :439) are published as literal text on the hosted pages | 2 | 5 | 1 | **35** | Operator task (values); listed in [PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md) |
| TD-45 | Backend | Compat shims from the `campus`→`institution` / `plan`→`mode` rename (CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP §20.5). Four remain, all waiting on the installed-app fleet, which cannot be measured yet: (6) the app reads `config.plan` when `mode` is empty (`AppRemoteConfig.kt:199-204`, `ApiDtos.kt:79`); (7) the app falls back to the old `plan` pref key (`AppRemoteConfig.kt:216-225`); (8) the backend writes a `plan` mirror into `/v1/config`, licence summaries and user documents (`repo/_base.py:222-230` `_mode_patch`, read back by `_license_mode` at `:233-237`; `repo/user_config.py:221` in `/v1/config`, written to the user at `:318` and deleted at `:322`; `repo/mint.py:64,130`; `licenses.py:81` `legacy_plan`); (9) `normalize_mode` / `normalize_kind` read `plan` / `campus` values in stored documents (`licenses.py:86,98`) | 2 | 2 | 2 | **16** | **Partly fixed.** Backend quick-wins PR: the never-called `/v1/campus/*` invite-revoke alias deleted; `LICENSE_ACTIVATE` audits `mode`. 2026-09-26: shims 1–5 retired on signals checked live that day — `PRO_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER` read (on neither Cloud Run service), the ID-token-only `/uploads` read and `REQUIRE_ATTESTED_UPLOADS` (0 `legacy_unattested_uploads` in 30 days of logs), `kind="campus"` at mint and the `plan` config patch (now 422s; no tooling sends them, 0 calls to the route), and the four `/v1/campus/*` seat routes in the router and gateway spec (0 requests in 30 days). Open: 6–9. Signals — 6/7/8: Play Console version distribution shows a `mode`-reading build is the fleet (6 ships with 7); 9: migration 002 has reached every document and #8 stopped writing the mirror (a Firestore count of users with no `mode` and licences with `kind == "campus"` is zero) |
| TD-69 | Build | Every Gradle run warns "Deprecated Gradle features were used … incompatible with Gradle 10". `--warning-mode all --stacktrace` traces it to one call: `ReportingExtension.file(String)` from `io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.DetektPlugin.apply` (`DetektPlugin.kt:28`), detekt `1.23.8` (`gradle/libs.versions.toml:31`); nothing in our build scripts. Gradle 10 removes the method, so the wrapper cannot move to 10 until detekt ships a fix | 1 | 2 | 1 | **15** | Open (found 2026-09-24): wait for a detekt release that drops the call. Do not bump the wrapper to 10 before then. Dependabot will not propose it: the gradle ecosystem ignores minor and patch updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`), and detekt 2 is a different id, so check by hand. Re-checked 2026-10-08 on Maven Central: the newest 1.x is still `1.23.8`; the only newer line is detekt 2.0 under `dev.detekt`, at `2.0.0-alpha.6`. Re-checked 2026-10-19: the same two versions on Maven Central, and the 1.23.8 plugin's sources show `DetektPlugin.apply` sets `reportsDir` from `ReportingExtension.file("detekt")` unconditionally (`DetektPlugin.kt:28`), so no setting of ours avoids the warning; the way out is the detekt 2.x migration (new plugin id, config and some rule names) |
| TD-155 | Performance | Three of Semper's real-device benchmark tests have no Pixel 6 reference, so `scripts/ci_test_report.py --gates` never gates them: `StartupBenchmark.coldStartup`, `StartupBenchmark.warmStartup` and `ScreenBenchmark.analysisWizardColdStartup` (`benchmark/gates.json`, `oriole`). On 2026-10-05 (benchmark build of `d4b86d91`, signed in, on AC) the phone held thermal status 0 for 3 minutes before each class, and these three ended at status 1 (cold start 609 ms, warm start 62 ms, wizard 820 ms); so did 5 of 8 such class runs earlier that day. The other four tests stayed at 0 and are the references now. `gates.json` gates a result only at `"maxThermalStatus": 0` ([ADR-008](../adr/ADR-008-startup-gates-phone-state.md)) | 1 | 2 | 2 | **12** | Open. Retry the three on a cooler phone: one class per `am instrument` call, pulling its `*benchmarkData.json` and `*deviceState.json` before the next (each call overwrites both), after the phone holds status 0, and add each test that stays at 0 on the charger to `oriole`. If the cold start never does, decide whether this phone gates startup at status 1 |
| TD-172 | Code | `NoiseFloorProbe`, `NoiseFloorStats` and `NoiseFloorPixels` (871 lines, `ui/analysis/recommend/`) have no production caller: outside those three files they are named only in KDoc. They estimate the measurement floor from a burst of static test frames (`NoiseFloorProbe.kt:17-28`); they stay because `NoiseFloorProbeTest`, `NoiseFloorStatsTest`, `NoiseCorrelationTest` and `NoiseFloorProbeParamsTest` back them and [NOISE_FLOOR_STRAIN_ACCURACY.md](../app/NOISE_FLOOR_STRAIN_ACCURACY.md) describes them (kept on purpose in #320) | 1 | 1 | 1 | **10** | Open, by choice (owner kept it 2026-10-13): the three files and their tests stay. Revisit if an import should supply a measured floor (the CONTEXT trap says none does) |
| TD-176 | App / backend | The move to `com.sempermechanics.semper` ([ADR-019](../adr/ADR-019-sempermechanics-app-id.md)) keeps the old ids working: the engine forwarders `Java_com_indicvision_semper_*` (six of them, engine `adapters/android/jni/SemperJNI.cpp:256-289`, at `1284edf`), the old ids in `backend/app/apps.py:40-41` and their registration refusal (`apps.RETIRED`, `:51`; `410 app_retired`), the old packages in `firebase-hosting/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json:24-44`, the `INDIC_*` fallbacks (`app/build.gradle.kts:35-41`) and `vars.INDIC_API_BASE_URL` (`.github/workflows/release.yml:130-132`; the repo has `INDIC_API_BASE_URL` and no `SEMPER_API_BASE_URL`, so that fallback is in use). Each is dead once no installed build sends an old id. The access log now names the id each call sends (`appId`: `backend/app/apps.py:73`, `observability.py:20`, `main.py:222`; a listed id, `none` or `unknown`) | 1 | 2 | 1 | **15** | Open. Logging the id is done; remove them once the log shows no old-id call. Query: `gcloud logging read 'resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND resource.labels.service_name="semper-api" AND jsonPayload.appId=~"^com\.indicvision\."' --freshness=30d --limit=20`. It sees only lines written after the deploy that adds `appId`; older lines are `textPayload`, with no `appId`. Rename the repo variable before dropping the `release.yml` fallback |
| TD-177 | Performance | Three small slowdowns after the quality program held on the Pixel 6 in both rounds of the 2026-10-05 A/B, whichever build ran first ([QUALITY_PROGRAM_RESULTS.md](QUALITY_PROGRAM_RESULTS.md) §7.1, `ff0cfc3d` against `691fbdd5`): warm start's first frame +13 ms, 62 → 75 and 59 → 72 ms (`benchmark/src/main/java/com/sempermechanics/semper/benchmark/StartupBenchmark.kt:43`, Home's restart path in `ui/home/HomeActivity.kt`); `generateHeatmap` +5 %, 19.0 → 19.7 / 20.2 ms (now `render(HeatmapRequest)`, `report/VisualizationEngine.kt:107`, whose pixel loop was moved whole into `HeatmapRenderer`); `buildReport` +2.3 %, 193 → 198 ms (`report/ReportBuilder.kt:130`). Allocation counts are unchanged. The micro times are from the debuggable build | 1 | 1 | 2 | **8** | Open.

| TD-209 | Backend / App | One public key per device id, whatever the app: `devices/{deviceId}` is written by `register_device` (`backend/app/repo/devices.py:111`, write at `:158`) and read by `verified_device` (`backend/app/deps.py:375`, key at `:443`, in `_signature_ok`), and the id is `and-{ANDROID_ID}` (`data/account/DeviceKeys.kt:62`), which Android shares between apps signed with one key. Two such apps on one phone (debug builds of Semper and Material Testing) take the key from each other, and the other's signed calls fail `401 bad_signature` (`deps.py:422`; since #457 at once, before the signature, when the record names the other app, `:379-389`). Bounded since 2026-10-10: retired `com.indicvision.*` ids may not register (`backend/app/apps.py:51`, `routers/devices.py:19`; `410 app_retired`, live in production since the 2026-10-10 deploy, run 38032569176), and a refused call registers again and is re-sent once, at most once a minute per process (`data/net/SemperApiCalls.kt:68`, `data/net/DeviceKeyRecovery.kt:84`) | 1 | 2 | 3 | **9** | Open. Release builds of the two apps have different signing keys, so only testers meet it. A fix keys the device by app (`devices/{app}:{deviceId}`, or an app field checked at verification) and needs a migration of `devices/` on the production database staging shares, plus every reader of `get_device` (`device_in_use`, erasure, the consoles' device history) |
| TD-210 | Backend / perf | A Firestore transaction's begin and commit take no timeout in google-cloud-firestore's public API (2.32.0, `backend/requirements.txt:4`). Checked again on 2026-10-19 in the 2.32.0 wheel: `Transaction._begin` and `_commit` call the GAPIC `begin_transaction` and `commit` with `metadata` only (`google/cloud/firestore_v1/transaction.py:80-102`, `:126-154`), and neither `Transaction(client, max_attempts, read_only)` (`:61`) nor `@transactional` (`:335`) takes a timeout or a retry; only the reads `get_all` and `get` do (`:155`, `:186`). So begin and commit keep the client's 60 s default, the gateway's whole deadline, and a contended transaction may begin and commit up to `_TX_ATTEMPTS` (10, `backend/app/repo/_base.py:47`) times. The reads inside a transaction do carry the 10 s read deadline (#432: `_get(ref, transaction)`, `repo/_base.py:90-96`; constants `:66-70`). Every transaction is created in `_run_tx` (`repo/_base.py:159`) for one of 16 `@firestore.transactional` bodies (`repo/claims.py:195`, `:291`; `repo/license_admin.py:231` (`_clear_fanout`, since #457's TD-294); `repo/devices.py:148` (device registration, since #457), `:200`; `repo/devlock.py:144`; `repo/leases.py:87`, `:146`, `:207`; `repo/mint.py:219`; `repo/seats.py:243`, `:300`, `:353`; `repo/sessions.py:211`, `:246` (`start_provisioning`, since #457's TD-296), `:615`; recounted at `9aa8cd1`); the row said 15 before #457 but listed 14, which was the count. Recorded as not covered in [CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md](../backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md) §10.1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | **8** | Open, **needs a decision** (not taken on #457, 2026-10-19: the client offers nothing to set). The options: (a) an overall deadline around each `_run_tx` call (a worker thread with a timeout; the abandoned gRPC call still runs to its own 60 s, and a commit may land after the caller gave up); (b) call `begin_transaction` and `commit` with `timeout=` through the client's private `_firestore_api`, re-checked on every client bump; (c) a shorter default deadline for every call the client makes, reads included; (d) accept it and say so in §10.1. Revisit when the client exposes a timeout on begin and commit |
| TD-212 | Perf / docs | The on-device characterization was measured with the AKAZE-seeded engine (pin `1284edf`): its seeding row (`docs/perf/on-device-characterization.md:65`) and the step=20 note (`:45`) describe a seeder engine 0.3.0 replaced with the anchor lattice. The note at `:10` says so, but no number for the current pin exists | 1 | 1 | 2 | **8** | Open. Re-run `SyntheticWorkloadDriver` LIGHT and LARGE on the Pixel 6 at the 0.6.0 pin and replace the tables. Engine 0.6.0 seeds the anchor lattice from an AKAZE + RANSAC homography again (with the lattice kept), so the seeding row measures AKAZE plus the lattice, not the 0.3.0–0.5.x phase correlation |
| TD-214 | Ops / IAM | **Framework 3.4, 5.5.** The runtime SA `indic-api@` holds no Firebase Auth role on the Auth project `indicvision-dic-app-auth`, so `revoke_sessions` and `delete_auth_user` (`backend/app/google_auth.py:104`, `:121`) return False and only say so in the audit row (`sessionsRevoked`, `routers/admin.py:84-96`; `authUserDeleted`, `backend/app/services/account.py:124`, `:132`; since #457 for every Auth user linked to the account). `CHECK_REVOKED_ON_STEP_UP` is off by default (`backend/app/config.py:245-247`; `deploy-backend.yml:340`) because the check fails closed without the grant (`backend/app/step_up.py:173-174`, `:223-229`). `check_gcp_posture.sh` item 3.4-iam passes only on `roles/firebaseauth.admin`, `roles/firebase.admin` or a custom role with `firebaseauth.users.update` and `.delete` (`scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh:315-353`) | 3 | 3 | 1 | **30** | **Operator task.** `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding indicvision-dic-app-auth --member=serviceAccount:indic-api@indicvision-dic-app.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/firebaseauth.admin`, then set the repo variable `CHECK_REVOKED_ON_STEP_UP=true` and redeploy ([BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md](../backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md) A8). Acceptance (3.4 Verify): "Test: disable a user, then call an activation function within the 1-hour token window and expect rejection"; here, a console step-up call within the hour answers 401 `invalid_token` with an `AUTH_DENIED` row, stage `revoked` |
| TD-215 | Ops / licensing | **Framework 4.1, 4.3, 3.5.** No entitlement signing key exists yet, so `/v1/config` carries no `entitlement` (`backend/app/entitlement_token.py:264-266`, `routers/account.py:175-189`) and every app keeps the pre-token behaviour (`EntitlementPolicy.intake`, `data/account/entitlement/EntitlementPolicy.kt:151`, answers IGNORE when the build pins no key). Owed: the P-256 key in Secret Manager, the repo variable `ENTITLEMENT_SIGNING_SECRET` that `deploy-backend.yml:258-278` mounts, `roles/secretmanager.viewer` for the deploy SA and `secretAccessor` on the secret for the runtime SA, and the public key in `SEMPER_ENTITLEMENT_PUBKEYS` for release builds ([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) variables) | 3 | 2 | 1 | **25** | **Operator task**, in [BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md](../backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md) A8.

| TD-216 | Ops / deploy | **Framework 5.1, 5.3.** The roster import, export, summary and audit routes need, before they answer: the composite index `audit_logs (licenseId ASC, ts DESC)` (`backend/firestore.indexes.json:88-102`; without it the audit page fails `FAILED_PRECONDITION`), and eight gateway paths (`backend/gateway/openapi.yaml:870-963`, `:1228-1305`; ESPv2 404s an undeclared path). The follow-up branch `claude/readiness-followups-jhfhj9` adds to the same deploy: the `seats.uid` / `deleted_seats.uid` collection-group index for erasure (TD-271), `POST /v1/admin/licenses/search` at the gateway (`openapi.yaml:650-668`), which the desk's search calls, and the staff desk's roster tools on `/v1/admin/licenses/{id}/…` (declared since #448); and, for ADR-024, `POST /v1/me/claim` at the gateway (`openapi.yaml:207-226`), which the account page's claim card calls, beside the backend that enforces kill switches and the demo device cap. Order: indexes (`scripts/deploy-firestore.sh indexes`, wait for the build), backend, gateway `apply`, Hosting (`scripts/deploy-console.sh`), then monitoring (`scripts/apply-monitoring.sh`, TD-217) | 2 | 2 | 1 | **20** | **Operator task** at the next deploy. Acceptance (5.7 Verify, "Doc review. API contract tests."): an anonymous call to each new path through the gateway answers 401, not 404, and `GET …/audit` answers 200 for a licence administrator; after the follow-up, an anonymous `POST /v1/admin/licenses/search` and an anonymous `POST /v1/me/claim` answer 401 |
| TD-217 | Ops / monitoring | **Framework 7.1-7.3; the verifier for 2.1-3.7.** `ops/monitoring/` and `scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh` are tested only against a stub `gcloud` and `curl` (`backend/tests/test_script_ops_gcp.py`, `scripts/tests/fixtures/gcp/`). Unproven until a real run: the uptime check's OIDC auth to the private service, the burn-rate filter syntax, and the JSON shapes the posture script parses. Posture item `2.7-backup` passes on a daily managed backup schedule, or, given `--backup-bucket`, on an export from `firestore-backup.yml` younger than 48 h; without `--backup-bucket` and with no schedule it reports UNKNOWN (`scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh:279-313`) | 2 | 2 | 1 | **20** | **Operator task.** `scripts/apply-monitoring.sh --project indicvision-dic-app --notification-channel <id> --apply`, then the posture script against both projects with `--backup-bucket` set to the `FIRESTORE_BACKUP_BUCKET` variable; record the output in the gate.

Release builds compile no certificate pin while the `SEMPER_API_CERT_PINS` secret is empty (the check warns; `.github/workflows/release.yml:136`) | 1 | 2 | 1 | **15** | **Partly done.** Tier 5 of CI run 39158239853 (`ae4c24a`) ran the step "Inspect release APK hardening" on a signed release APK and passed, so the check reads real `aapt2` output and the fixture concern is met (re-checked 2026-10-19). Open: only the decision on pins (a pin set needs a backup pin and follows the gateway's certificate chain). Acceptance (1.5 Verify): "APK inspection in CI (MASWE-0067 'Debuggable Flag Not Disabled', MASWE-0089 'Code Obfuscation Not Implemented')" |
| TD-219 | App / CI | **Framework 1.5, 4.1, 4.3, 5.6, 6.1, 6.4.** The Android half of the 2026-10-18 readiness change (minSdk 24 to 30, `app/build.gradle.kts:130`; ES256 entitlement verification, grace and clock rollback under `data/account/entitlement/`; the version gate `data/policy/VersionGate.kt:33` and `ui/limit/UpdateRequiredActivity.kt:22`; kill switches `data/policy/KillSwitch.kt:11`; managed configuration `data/policy/ManagedConfigReader.kt:38-70`; consent-gated breadcrumbs `diagnostics/CrashReportingTree.kt:23-41`; certificate pins and entitlement keys from the environment, `app/build.gradle.kts:80-93`) was written where `dl.google.com` was blocked, so it was not compiled there. The follow-up branch `claude/readiness-followups-jhfhj9` adds more Android code of the same kind (`SealedRecordStore`, the one-off `license-config-now` refresh, `UpdateSource`, the shown cap, the floating-lapse route to the seat screen; and, for ADR-024, `ui/limit/LicenseRefresh`, `data/policy/FeatureLocks`, `ui/common/dialog/LicenseLock`, `ui/home/HomeLicenseNotice` and the paused-feature handling, with the `ui/account/` package removed) that no CI run has compiled yet | 2 | 2 | 1 | **20** | **Partly closed.** The compile and unit-test half is done: CI run 39158239853 on #448's head `ae4c24a` passed Tier 1, Tier 3 (emulator), Tier 4, Tier 5 and the rules job; run 39206485965 on #449's head `95f5607` passed the same with `full-ci`, the follow-up's Robolectric suites and Kover included; material_testing#137 and #138 passed Tier 1, 3 and 5 (runs 39156925646, 39206773873). Both merged 2026-10-19. Open, on a device: an install on Android 11 and the refusal on Android 10, the version gate raised on staging (TD-220), a token verified against a provisioned key (TD-215), managed configuration in an EMM (TD-257). Acceptance (4.3 Verify): "Time-travel tests (Part E)" (`EntitlementClockTest`, `SealedRecordStoreTest`, `EntitlementRefreshTest`), green in run 39206485965, and a device smoke of the first release built from `main` |
| TD-220 | Ops / release | **Framework 6.1, 6.4.** The release levers are deploy variables: `MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION_CODE`, `RECOMMENDED_VERSION_CODE` and their `_MATERIAL_TESTING` pair (each app gets its own, `settings.release_gate(app)`), `KILL_SWITCHES`, `ENTITLEMENT_OFFLINE_GRACE_DAYS` (`deploy-backend.yml:327-334`; `backend/app/config.py:278-317`). None has been moved on a running service and watched on a phone | 2 | 2 | 1 | **20** | **Open.** Drill on `semper-api-staging` with a staging build: set each, redeploy, confirm the app's response, set it back; record the result in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md). Acceptance (6.4 Verify): "Flag toggle drill in staging"; (6.1 Verify) "Test: raise the minimum, confirm the gating UX" |
| TD-221 | Ops / GCP | **Framework 2.1.** Production project protection is unrecorded: a lien on `resourcemanager.projects.delete`, a `Prod` tag, two or more owners, owners through Google groups. `scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh:118-159` reports each; it has not been run against `indicvision-dic-app` or `indicvision-dic-app-auth` ([PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md), "Confirm Firebase API key restrictions") | 2 | 3 | 1 | **25** | **Operator task.** Run the posture script; add the lien and the tag; move owners to a group. Acceptance (2.1 Verify): "`gcloud` output listing liens and IAM bindings. Firebase launch checklist items marked complete." |
| TD-222 | Ops / security | **Framework 2.4.** The Firebase API keys on both projects are limited to a list of APIs but carry no Android package / SHA-1 or referrer restriction (checked 2026-10-08; "Checked by hand" below). Posture item 2.4 (`scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh:160-180`) | 2 | 3 | 1 | **25** | **Operator task.** Restrict the Android key to the app ids with the release and Play signing SHA-1s, and the browser key to the Hosting origins. Acceptance (2.4 Verify): "API key restriction export" |
| TD-223 | Ops / security | **Framework 2.5.** The enabled sign-in providers and Auth abuse / enumeration protection are unconfirmed ([PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md), "Confirm Auth abuse / enumeration protections"). The app uses password, email link and Google; anonymous sign-in is unused. Posture item 2.5 (`scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh:181-208`) | 1 | 3 | 1 | **20** | **Operator task.** Acceptance (2.5 Verify): "Auth provider config screenshot" |
| TD-224 | Ops / cost | **Framework 2.6.** Spend is capped only by Cloud Run `--max-instances=10` (`deploy-backend.yml:341`) and the gateway quotas; there are no Cloud Functions to cap. A billing budget with alerts is not shown to exist or to reach anyone (posture item 2.6, `scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh:209-233`), and no budget notification disables billing | 2 | 2 | 2 | **16** | **Operator task**, then deferred: a budget whose Pub/Sub notification caps spend is optional. Acceptance (2.6 Verify): "Billing config. Alert test fired to on-call." |
| TD-225 | Ops / security | **Framework 3.7.** Data Access audit logs (DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE) for Firebase Management, Firebase Rules, App Check and Firestore are not confirmed on. Posture item 3.7 (`scripts/check_gcp_posture.sh:354-369`) | 1 | 2 | 1 | **15** | **Operator task.** Acceptance (3.7 Verify): "Log sink configuration" |
| TD-226 | Ops / security | **Framework 3.1.** `APP_CHECK_MODE` is `off` (`backend/app/config.py:230`; `deploy-backend.yml:324`). `_require_app_check` asks only callers that send `X-Device-Id` (`backend/app/deps.py:86-120`). Firestore needs no App Check (every client is denied, `firestore.rules:7-9`), and there is no Storage or Functions. `enforce` would 403 every installed build without App Check, and no build can get a Play Integrity token before TD-229 | 3 | 3 | 2 | **24** | **Blocked by TD-229.** `off` to `monitor`, watch `app_check_missing` / `app_check_invalid` reach zero across the installed fleet, then `enforce`; rollback is the variable ([INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md)). Acceptance (3.1 Verify): "Enforcement metrics in the App Check console show unverified requests rejected"; here, `AUTH_DENIED` rows with stage `app_check` and no rise in refused genuine calls |
| TD-227 | Ops / data | **Framework 2.9.** The production Firestore location is not recorded. Setup creates the database at `$REGION` = asia-south1 (`docs/backend/BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md:49`, `:81`); the schema section says "`nam5`/regional to match Cloud Run region" (`docs/backend/CLOUD_ARCHITECTURE_GCP.md:551`); the Privacy Policy still holds `[GCP REGION, e.g. asia-south1 (Mumbai)]` (`docs/legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md:153`, TD-36).

Acceptance (2.9 Verify): "Location documented in the DPA and architecture record" |
| TD-228 | Ops / deploy | **Framework Part D3.** A production deploy needs no human approval: no GitHub environment has required reviewers or a branch policy (Free plan; [ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md)); `deploy-backend.yml:74` only refuses production from a ref other than `main` | 2 | 2 | 2 | **16** | **Open** (plan constraint). Add reviewers to `production` when the plan allows. The repository now reports public (GitHub REST API, checked 2026-10-18), and GitHub offers required reviewers on public repositories on every plan, so check whether the setting is available now. Acceptance (Part D3): "Prod deploys need manual approval." |
| TD-229 | Ops / Play | **Framework 1.6.** No Play developer account is linked to the project, and the Play app-signing SHA-256 is not on the Firebase Android app ([PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md), "Play developer account"); until then no build can obtain an App Check token. The release certificate is in `firebase-hosting/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json`, which `release.yml` checks | 3 | 2 | 2 | **20** | **Operator task.** Acceptance (1.6 Verify): "Firebase console screenshot. Sign-in works on a Play-distributed build, not just a sideloaded one." |
| TD-230 | Ops / Play | **Framework 1.2.** No Play listing exists, so there is no pre-launch report. Builds are distributed as signed APKs from GitHub Releases ([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md), release checklist step 6) | 1 | 2 | 1 | **15** | **Operator task** once a listing exists. Acceptance (1.2 Verify): "Play Console pre-launch report attached to the review" |
| TD-231 | Ops / release | **Framework 1.1, 6.3.** The halt thresholds are written ([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md), "Staged rollout on Google Play"), but there is no closed track to measure them on and no rehearsal of a staged rollout and halt | 2 | 2 | 2 | **16** | **Operator task** after TD-229.

| TD-232 | Legal / Play | **Framework 8.4.** The Play Data safety form is not submitted. Draft answers from the SDK inventory: [PLAY_DATA_SAFETY.md](../legal/PLAY_DATA_SAFETY.md). Two gate items wait on it ([PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md), "Update the Google Play Data safety form" and "Google Play Data safety form: demo analysis content"). Whether the merged manifest carries `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID` (Firebase Analytics adds it unless removed) is unchecked | 2 | 3 | 1 | **25** | **Operator task.** Read the release APK's permissions (`aapt2 dump permissions`), settle the draft, submit. Acceptance (8.4 Verify): "Cross-check against the SDK inventory" |
| TD-233 | App | **Framework 6.2.** No Play In-App Updates: below `minSupportedVersionCode` the gate sends the user to the store or website (`UpdateRequiredActivity.openStore`, `ui/limit/UpdateRequiredActivity.kt:49`). Needs Play distribution (TD-229) and a priority set through the Play Developer API | 1 | 1 | 2 | **8** | **Deferred** until Play distribution. Acceptance (6.2 Verify): "Internal app sharing test of both flows" |
| TD-234 | Licensing / security | **Framework 4.2; Part B first activation, check-in and replacement; 7.3 (Play Integrity ratio).** Only the `dkt` binding is built (`backend/app/entitlement_token.py:102-111`). The device key is a non-exportable P-256 Keystore key with no attestation challenge and no StrongBox request (`data/account/DeviceKeys.kt:75-86`), and `register_device` stores its PEM unverified (`backend/app/repo/devices.py:111-158`, the key at `:132`). The backend reads no Play Integrity verdict (App Check is the only Integrity use, `app/build.gradle.kts:371`), so no failure ratio can be logged, and device recall is not used | 3 | 3 | 4 | **12** | **Deferred.** Server-side chain verification against both Google roots at registration; a standard-request Integrity verdict at activation and check-in with a graded policy; device recall after the beta form. Acceptance (4.2 Verify): "Activation on emulator or rooted device fails or is flagged according to policy" |
| TD-235 | App / resilience | **Framework Part B resilience controls (MASVS-RESILIENCE-1 to 4).** R8 obfuscation is the only resilience control (`app/build.gradle.kts:236`): no signature or installer check, no debugger or Frida detection, and no graded server response (flag, shorten grace, refuse) | 2 | 2 | 3 | **12** | **Deferred**; the server half depends on TD-234. Acceptance (Part E tamper tests): "Repackage the APK with patched verification and confirm Play Integrity `appIntegrity` fails at the next check-in and the server flags the device"; "Use Frida to hook the signature-verification function" |
| TD-236 | Backend / security | **Framework 3.5.** The entitlement signing key is a PEM in Secret Manager mounted into the process environment (`backend/app/config.py:268`; `deploy-backend.yml:258-278`), so the running service holds the private key. Cloud KMS asymmetric signing (`EC_SIGN_P256_SHA256`) would keep it out of the process, at one KMS call per issued token | 2 | 2 | 3 | **12** | **Deferred.** Acceptance (3.5 Verify): "Secret scanning (e.g., gitleaks) in CI. IAM policy review." |
| TD-237 | Backend / compliance | **Framework 5.3.** `audit_logs` is append-only in code but not against IAM: anyone with Firestore IAM on the project can edit or delete a row through the Admin API. No retention period or TTL is set ([FIRESTORE_DATA_PROTECTION.md](../backend/FIRESTORE_DATA_PROTECTION.md), "Account-erasure audit policy"). Done on 2026-10-19 on #457 (`2bd2eb9`): the backend only adds rows (`audit.record`, `backend/app/audit.py:71`, through `repo.add_audit_row`, `:93`; `backend/app/repo/audit_log.py:35`), and `backend/tests/test_audit_append_only.py` fails if another module names the collection or the audit repo updates, sets or deletes (`:46`, `:52`); the migration loader refuses one that walks an `APPEND_ONLY` collection without a `rewrites_append_only` reason (`backend/scripts/migrations/__init__.py:32`, `:62-67`), which 001 now gives (`backend/scripts/migrations/001_stamp_schema_version.py:17`; `test_audit_append_only.py:73`, `:83`); `firestore-rules-tests/rules.test.mjs:188-215` tries an update, merge, overwrite and delete of an audit row as every caller, an Org Owner's claims included, and is refused (61 pass against the emulator, per the commit); and every row is mirrored, before the Firestore write, as one Cloud Logging `audit_row` line under `auditRow` (logger `semper.audit_trail`; `_mirror`, `backend/app/audit.py:56-68`, called at `:91`; `test_audit_append_only.py:95`, `:113`, `:124`).

Owed, in order ([DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md) §6): deploy that backend, run the TD-246 backfill (stamps `expireAt` on older rows), then the `audit-trail` log bucket at `--retention-days=365`, the sink on `jsonPayload.event="audit_row"`, the bucket locked (irreversible), and last `gcloud firestore fields ttls update expireAt --collection-group=audit_logs --enable-ttl` ([FIRESTORE_DATA_PROTECTION.md](../backend/FIRESTORE_DATA_PROTECTION.md), "The audit trail is append-only").

| TD-238 | Licensing | **Framework 4.4; Part B revocation.** A device never confirms a revocation. It learns of one at its next `/v1/config` (`PERIOD_HOURS` = 4, `data/LicenseConfigWorker.kt:82`) or when its entitlement's `graceUntil` passes; the console's "revocation pending" is inferred from `lastSeenAt` against `revokedAt` (`backend/app/roster_io.py:219-235`; `backend/app/repo/reconcile.py:60`), so it cannot show "hold pending on the device" for a seat put on hold | 2 | 2 | 3 | **12** | **Deferred.** The app reports the entitlement it now holds (`lic`, `mode`, `iat`) on its next call, and the seat records `ackedAt`. Acceptance (4.4 Verify): "End-to-end test with the device offline, then online" |
| TD-240 | Security | **Framework 3.6; Part E penetration test scope.** No third-party test has been run. The scope is [PENTEST_SCOPE.md](PENTEST_SCOPE.md); the self-assessment it starts from is [MASVS_ASSESSMENT.md](MASVS_ASSESSMENT.md) | 3 | 3 | 3 | **18** | **External.** Commission before general availability; every critical and high finding closed or risk-accepted in the gate. Acceptance (3.6 Verify): "Third-party pentest report mapped to MASVS controls (scope in Part E)" |
| TD-241 | Legal / compliance | **Framework 8.2.** DPDP obligations apply from 13 May 2027. The Rule 7 playbook is [INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md). The Privacy Policy's breach clause (`docs/legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md:233-239`) promises notice to the authority "within the period required by law" and to users "without undue delay", which counsel should align with Rule 7; the Grievance Officer is unnamed (TD-36); counsel review is open; no tabletop has been run | 3 | 3 | 2 | **24** | **External** (counsel, operator). Acceptance (8.2 Verify): "Tabletop exercise record" |
| TD-246 | Backend / compliance | **Framework 5.3.** Audit rows written before 2026-10-18 carry no `licenseId` (stamped from then on, `backend/app/audit.py:81-83`, from `licence_of`, `:42`), and the per-licence export reads only stamped rows (`page_license_audit`, `backend/app/repo/audit_log.py:123-162`; docstring `:130-132`), so a licence's earlier history is absent from its export. A backfill rewrites rows in an append-only collection (TD-237). The backfill is written, not run (2026-10-19 on #457, `9aa8cd1`): `backend/scripts/stamp_audit_licence_ids.py` adds only `licenseId`, derived from each row's `target` as `record` does, to rows that lack it; dry-run by default, `--apply` refuses without `--decision` (`stamp`, `:80-88`) and records the decision and the counts in `_migrations/td246_stamp_audit_licence_ids` (`:54-55`); idempotent. Tests `backend/tests/test_script_stamp_audit_licence_ids.py` (`:60`, `:71`, `:97`, `:108`, `:115`) | 1 | 2 | 2 | **12** | **Decided; operator step owed.** The owner approved the backfill on 2026-10-22. Since then the same pass also stamps `expireAt` = `ts` + `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` on rows that lack it (TD-237; rows without `ts` are skipped and counted; `_updates`, `backend/scripts/stamp_audit_licence_ids.py:59-77`; the ledger also records `retentionDays` and both counts, `:95`, `:123-126`; tests `backend/tests/test_script_stamp_audit_licence_ids.py:90`, `:115`). Owed: run it once after the backend that writes `licenseId` and `expireAt` on new rows is deployed and before the TTL policy is enabled: dry run, then `--apply --decision "TD-246: backfill approved by <owner>, 2026-10-22"` ([DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md) §6). Acceptance (5.3 Verify): "Attempt to edit or delete audit entries as Org Owner and expect failure", and an export for a range before 2026-10-18 either returns its events or says that it cannot |
| TD-247 | App / data | **Framework 1.3.** Measurement records are not tamper-evident: a `.dat` is eight floats per point with no MAC, signature or sealed timestamp (`field/DicResult.kt:20-24`), and its bytes are pinned by the bit-exact oracles (`app/src/test/resources/oracles/`). Process death is survived through the wizard draft ([ADR-005](../adr/ADR-005-wizard-process-death.md)) | 2 | 2 | 3 | **12** | **Deferred; needs an ADR.** A sidecar manifest (SHA-256 per `.dat`, the run spec, a timestamp signed with the device key) leaves the `.dat` bytes unchanged. Acceptance (1.3 Verify): "Instrumented tests that kill the process mid-test-run and replay. Compare stored records with the source data." |
| TD-248 | Ops / backend | **Framework 2.1 (three projects), 2.8, Part D3, Part E.** Staging runs in the production project against the production Firestore database: `semper-api` and `semper-api-staging` are both in `indicvision-dic-app` under one runtime SA ([ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md), resource table). Load and chaos tests (TD-249, TD-250) cannot run against it, and TD-209's fix becomes a production migration | 2 | 3 | 4 | **10** | **Deferred.** A staging project with its own Firestore, Auth (or Auth tenant), Drive root, queue and gateway; `deploy-backend.yml`'s staging target moves to it. Acceptance (2.1 Verify): "`gcloud` output listing liens and IAM bindings" for three projects |
| TD-249 | Backend / perf | **Framework 2.8; Part E load testing.** No load test exists. Seat counts are one counter per licence document (`seatsUsed` / `leasesActive` increments, `backend/app/repo/claims.py:255`, `backend/app/repo/seats.py:366-372`), the hot spot Part E names for a 500-device onboarding. Blocked by TD-248 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **12** | **Blocked by TD-248.** Acceptance (2.8 Verify): "Load test report (Part E) and Key Visualizer screenshot with no hotspots" |
| TD-250 | Backend / ops | **Framework Part E chaos/failure tests.** No fault injection against a running environment. In unit form: `/healthz` stays 200 and `/readyz` 503s with both dependencies down (`backend/tests/test_health.py`), and a Drive outage during verify deletes nothing (`backend/tests/test_verify_degradation.py`). Found 2026-10-19: a Firestore outage on any route but `/readyz` (once the client's retries give up) reaches the edge middleware and answers 500 `internal_error` (`backend/app/main.py:195-203`); only the readiness ping maps it to 503 `firestore_unreachable` (`ping`, `backend/app/repo/_base.py:199-208`, through `obs.DependencyError`). Blocked by TD-248 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **9** | **Blocked by TD-248.** Before the drill, decide whether routes should answer a Firestore outage with 503 and `Retry-After` (a wire change: the app's retry treats a 503 apart, `data/net/RetryOnTransient.kt:33-40`) or keep the 500 and say so. Acceptance (Part E): "Disable the check-in function in staging. Inject Firestore `UNAVAILABLE`/`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` errors. … Restore Firestore from PITR into a new database, then repoint staging." |
| TD-251 | Release | **Framework 6.5.** Backend changes follow expand/contract ([FIRESTORE_SCHEMA_RUNBOOK.md](../backend/FIRESTORE_SCHEMA_RUNBOOK.md); the §20.5 skew fallbacks) and the wire bodies are pinned (`backend/tests/test_wire_contracts.py`, over `contracts/`), but no job runs released app builds against a new backend | 2 | 2 | 3 | **12** | **Deferred.** Acceptance (6.5 Verify): "Compatibility matrix CI job (N-2 versions)" |
| TD-252 | Observability | **Framework 7.1 (alerts).** Crashlytics velocity alerts and their routing are Firebase-console settings outside `ops/monitoring/` (`ops/monitoring/README.md:104-108`); none is confirmed | 1 | 2 | 1 | **15** | **Operator task.** Acceptance (7.1 Verify): "Alert routing test" |
| TD-253 | Observability / app | **Framework 7.1 (Performance Monitoring).** The Performance Monitoring SDK is not in the app (`app/build.gradle.kts:354-418`). Adding it changes the Data safety answers (TD-232) and has to sit behind the diagnostics consent (`AppSettings.diagnosticsEnabled`) | 1 | 1 | 2 | **8** | **Deferred.** Acceptance (7.1 Verify): "Alert routing test", on startup, sync and activation traces |
| TD-255 | Backend / console | **Framework 5.1; Part C console essentials.** Built: tiles for assigned, on hold, active in 7 days, invited, revocation pending and expiring (`backend/app/roster_io.py:202-243`), CSV import and export. Missing: per-device last check-in and app version on a roster row (`_seat_public`, `backend/app/repo/institution_admin.py:157-172`), and a bulk "release stale devices" action | 2 | 1 | 3 | **9** | **Deferred.** Acceptance (5.1 Verify): "Usability test with an IT admin persona. Task completion time recorded." |
| TD-256 | Product | **Framework 5.1.** No usability test of the institution console with an IT-administrator persona has been run | 2 | 1 | 2 | **12** | **External.** Acceptance (5.1 Verify): "Usability test with an IT admin persona. Task completion time recorded." |
| TD-257 | App / EMM | **Framework 5.6; Part C EMM.** The managed-configuration schema (`app/src/main/res/xml/app_restrictions.xml`: `accountEmailDomain`, `cloudBackupAllowed`, `backupOnUnmeteredOnly`; `enrollmentInvite` removed 2026-10-18, ADR-024) and its reader (`data/policy/ManagedConfigReader.kt:38-70`) have not been tried in an EMM. Managed configurations reach only production-track or private apps, and `ssoProviderId` / `updateMode` wait on FI-17 / FI-22 | 2 | 1 | 2 | **12** | **External.** Acceptance (5.6 Verify): "Test in at least one EMM (e.g., Intune, or Android Management API test DPC)" |
| TD-258 | Ops / support | **Framework Part D6, 6.6.** [SUPPORT_POLICY.md](SUPPORT_POLICY.md) leaves response targets and maintenance windows to the business (TBD); there is no status page; the Terms state no deprecation notice period | 1 | 2 | 2 | **12** | **External** (business). Acceptance (6.6 Verify): "Release notes archive"; (Part D6) "publish severity definitions, response targets, a supported-version policy …, maintenance windows, and a status page" |
| TD-261 | Licensing / risk | **Framework 4.3; Part B clock-tampering resistance (residual risk).** On a rooted phone, removing the sealed entitlement record's HMAC key makes the store read as never having held a token, so the app falls back to the unsigned cached `/v1/config`. Since TD-265 (closed above, on the follow-up branch) that holds for deleting the key alone as well as both: a record with no key reads as no token and is dropped, so a lost Keystore key is not mistaken for tampering (`EntitlementPolicy.reading`, `data/account/entitlement/EntitlementPolicy.kt:137-144`; `SealedRecordStore.load`, `data/account/entitlement/SealedRecordStore.kt`; no token is `TokenStatus.NotUsed`, unbounded, `EntitlementPolicy.kt:91-92`). Writing the first-seal mark (`PrefFiles.Entitlement.SEALING`, in the same preference file) beside a deleted record has the same effect. Only a key with neither record nor mark, or a MAC mismatch, is detected as tampering | 1 | 2 | 3 | **9** | **Accepted as residual risk** (the framework: "This is not tamper-proof on a rooted device … The server-side bound (`exp`, seat revocation at next check-in) is the real control"). Revisit with TD-234 / TD-235. Acceptance (4.3 Verify): "Time-travel tests (Part E)"; a test that a missing record with a present key and no first-seal mark reads as tampered (`EntitlementPolicyTest`, `SealedRecordStoreTest`) |
| TD-271 | Ops / deploy | **Framework 8.5.** Erasure finds every seat an account held with a collection-group query on `uid` (`_seats_of`, `backend/app/repo/account.py:156-183`), which needs the single-field COLLECTION_GROUP index on `seats.uid` and `deleted_seats.uid` (`backend/firestore.indexes.json:161-204`, fieldOverrides). Until it is deployed and built the query fails: erasure blanks only the current licence's seat, logs `erasure_seat_scan_failed` (`backend/app/repo/account.py:177-178`), and the `ACCOUNT_DELETE` row says `seatScanComplete: false`. Accounts erased before the change keep their `auth_links` rows and seat addresses; no sweep for them is written | 2 | 2 | 1 | **20** | **Operator task** at the next deploy: `scripts/deploy-firestore.sh indexes` and wait for the overrides to build, then the backend (the order in TD-216). Then decide on a one-off sweep for earlier erasures (an `auth_links` row or a seat whose `uid` has no `users` document). Acceptance (8.5 Verify): "Scripted test"; here, `gcloud firestore indexes fields describe uid --collection-group=seats` lists an ascending COLLECTION_GROUP index, and the next erasure's `ACCOUNT_DELETE` row has `seatScanComplete: true` |
| TD-273 | Backend / privacy | **Framework 7.4.** After TD-244 (closed above) `GET /v1/admin/licenses` still answers `q` for one release (`backend/app/routers/admin.py:149-171`) and logs `deprecated_query_search` with the caller's uid, never the value (`:167-169`). A staff script or a desk page cached before the Hosting deploy that sends `?q=<address>` still puts an address in the request logs | 1 | 1 | 1 | **10** | **Open, low.** Once the release after the follow-up has shipped and `deprecated_query_search` shows no caller for 30 days, drop `q` from the GET and from its description in `backend/gateway/openapi.yaml:623-649`. Acceptance (7.4 Verify): "Log sampling review"; here, no `deprecated_query_search` line in the 30 days before removal |
| TD-274 | Licensing / risk | **Framework Part B resilience controls; Part E licence bypass and tamper tests (residual risk).** Share (PNG, GIF, PDF, CSV, ZIP) has no backend route: the app decides it from the cached `/v1/config` and the signed token (`LicenseEntitlements.shareLicensed`, `data/account/LicenseEntitlements.kt:85-86`; `ShareCenter.access`, `ui/viewer/share/ShareCenter.kt:209-210`; guard `:43-47`). A modified APK that skips the check, or a hooked `EntitlementVerifier`, shares without a licence. It gains no cloud access: every cloud route checks the account on the server ([ADR-024](../adr/ADR-024-account-anchored-entitlements.md), "Server-side checks per request") | 1 | 2 | 3 | **9** | **Accepted as residual risk** (ADR-024 decision 5). Revisit with TD-235, or as soon as share gains a server route (a server-rendered export, a share link): that route then refuses a demo account with 403 `feature_not_licensed`, as restore does. Acceptance (Part E): the pentest's repackaged-APK case ([PENTEST_SCOPE.md](PENTEST_SCOPE.md)) records that a patched build shares and that its cloud calls are still refused for a demo account; for any future share route, a backend test that a demo account is refused |
| TD-275 | Licensing / product | **Framework 4.1 (entitlement enforced server-side).** The demo cap counts analyses **stored at once**, per account (`count_user_sessions`, `backend/app/repo/sessions.py:445-463`) and, since 2026-10-18, per device (`count_device_sessions`, `:466-490`; applied for demo at `backend/app/services/sessions.py:138-139`). Deleting an analysis frees its place (`DELETE /v1/sessions/{sid}`, `backend/app/routers/sessions.py:109-136`), so a demo user can delete and continue indefinitely; erasing the account deletes its sessions (`backend/app/repo/account.py:228-229`), so erase-and-rejoin resets both counts | 1 | 1 | 3 | **6** | **Accepted by decision** (product owner, 2026-10-18; ADR-024 "Why stored-at-once"): the cap is a nudge, not a meter, and an ever-created count would need a counter that survives erasure. Revisit only if the product owner changes the cap's meaning. Acceptance (4.1 Verify): a backend test that, at the demo cap on one device, deleting one analysis lets the next `POST /v1/sessions` through (the stored-at-once behaviour pinned), beside `backend/tests/test_demo_device_cap.py` |
| TD-277 | Legal / Play | **Framework 8.4 (Play policy consistency).** The Terms the app links (`legal_terms_url`, `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml:438`; opened from `ui/settings/SettingsFooterSection.kt:35`, `ui/settings/SettingsYourDataSection.kt:75` and `ui/auth/TermsActivity.kt:63`) were aligned with ADR-024 on 2026-10-19: 6.2 names the account-anchored sources (seat, email-locked licence, claim code on the account page), the new 6.6 says the App sells, prices and takes payment for nothing, and "licence key" became "claim code" in 2.3, 3.3 and 5 (`docs/legal/TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md:53-55,73-74,126-127,149-180`; rendered to `firebase-hosting/public/terms/index.html`). The **Version** stays 2026-09-15, so no user is asked to accept again: under 17.1 the edit is treated as non-material (it describes how access is obtained and what the App does not do; no right or fee changes). Fees, refunds and price changes for access arranged outside the App (6.2–6.5) stay. Whether that holds under Google Play's Payments policy (https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10281818), and whether the edit is material, are for counsel | 2 | 1 | 1 | **15** | **External** (counsel). Text done; counsel's word owed. If counsel calls the edit material, bump **Version** with `backend/app/legal.py:10`, `LegalTerms.TERMS_VERSION` (`app/src/main/java/com/sempermechanics/semper/data/account/LegalTerms.kt:18`) and the `contracts/` fixtures in one commit. Acceptance (8.4 Verify; here, the Play policy review): counsel's sign-off recorded in the gate, and `python scripts/render_legal_pages.py --check` passing |
| TD-278 | Backend / contracts | **Framework 6.5 (expand/contract).** `POST /v1/licenses/activate` stays for installed builds and support recovery (`backend/app/routers/licenses.py:50-82`), and with it `contracts/license_activate_request.json`, read only by the backend's wire-contract test (`backend/tests/test_wire_contracts.py:51`); the app's contract test no longer asserts it (e084f39). No released build of Semper calls the route from a screen (v1.2-beta.4, `33dce87d`, has `SemperApi.activateLicense` and no caller) | 1 | 1 | 1 | **10** | **Open, low.** When the route's `activation` events without `via` show no caller for 30 days, remove the route, its gateway path, `LicenseActivate` (`backend/app/models.py:177-179`) and the fixture together, keeping `license_activate_response.json`, which the seat routes still answer in. Acceptance (6.5 Verify): the wire-contract suite passes without the request fixture, and `backend/tests/test_gateway_parity.py` passes without the path |
| TD-294 | Backend | Two licence-wide writes span documents outside one transaction: `revoke_license` writes the licence, every seat and every holder in separate writes, and `update_license` fans the new terms out after writing the licence, so a crash between steps left a holder licensed on a revoked seat, or on the old terms, until the action was repeated. Built on 2026-10-19 on #457 (`31675bc`, [ADR-026](../adr/ADR-026-licence-fanout-marker.md)), not deployed: both write the licence together with a pending fan-out marker (`fanoutId` / `fanoutOps` / `fanoutAt`, `backend/app/repo/license_admin.py:197-205`; `_write_with_fanout`, `:208-225`, called at `:153` and `:456`), after scheduling a Cloud Task due 360 s later (`tasks.enqueue_license_fanout`, `backend/app/tasks.py:100`; `FANOUT_TASK_DELAY_S`, `:33`). The call still runs the fan-out inline from the licence as it then stands and clears the marker only while it is its own, running again when overtaken, up to `FANOUT_PASSES` (`_finish_fanout`, `:262-281`; `_clear_fanout`, `:228-246`). The task's callback, `POST /v1/tasks/license-fanout` (`backend/app/routers/provision_tasks.py:23-29`; OIDC like the provisioning callback, kept off the gateway, `backend/tests/test_gateway_parity.py:45`), finishes what a dead call left (`finish_license_fanout`, `:284-296`, logging `license_fanout_finished_late`); a failed enqueue logs `license_fanout_enqueue_failed` (`tasks.py:138`); reconcile reports `fanoutPending` (`backend/app/repo/reconcile.py:191`). Tests `backend/tests/test_license_fanout.py` (`:58`, `:85`: each call killed between the licence write and the holders, finished by the task). The third, `set_seat_enabled`, was fixed earlier on #457 (`e61eb09`): the holder is read inside the transaction and written in the seat's commit, only while still pointed at this licence (`backend/app/repo/seats.py:277-336`); tests `backend/tests/test_seat_lease_counters.py:156`, `:178` | 3 | 3 | 4 | **12** | **Built; open until deployed** (review A4). Without `TASKS_QUEUE` and `TASKS_TARGET_BASE_URL` (`settings.tasks_enabled`, `backend/app/config.py:386`) no task is scheduled and the inline run is the only one. At deploy ([DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md) §2, §6): confirm the environment's `TASKS_QUEUE` is set, then watch `license_fanout_enqueue_failed` (should be 0) and `license_fanout_finished_late` (each one is a call that died part-way, now repaired). Close once a staging revoke's task has run and found nothing pending. Acceptance (met in unit form above): a test that kills the call between the licence write and the holder writes and shows the follow-up completing it |
| TD-298 | App / fork | [ADR-025](../adr/ADR-025-test-type-extension-points.md) (Proposed) is not carried out: material_testing still keeps about 54 lab branch points in 23 shared Kotlin files and fork code in 50, merged again at every sync (ADR-025 Context), and #457's UI fixes reach it only by merge (its TD-305). The step that has to come before any build on extensions: the fork's `index.json` keeps eight lab fields at the top level and `SessionStore` reads with `ignoreUnknownKeys` (`data/session/SessionStore.kt:43`), so the first such build would drop them on its next write unless `SessionExtension.legacyKeys` moves them into `extras` first | 4 | 3 | 3 | **21** | **Needs an owner decision** (accept ADR-025 or not), then its phases 1–5 (ADR-025 Action items), smallest first. Acceptance (phase 2): a 2026-10 fork `index.json` read and written back with the same meaning, and the lab CSV byte-identical |
| TD-299 | Engine / app | The 2026-10-19 review's engine fixes are not in the app: an even or zero subset size wrote past its buffers (E1), one process-wide cancel token could be used after free (E2), an unconverged anchor solve was accepted (E3), and fixes to IC-GN validity and conditioning (E4–E6), image checks (E7, E8) and the contract (E9 `kSeedFailed`, E10 metrics slot 23) followed. They are semper-dic-engine#9 (branch `ccr-603fe346-1bw2fa`, head `72d957c`, "0.5.0"; open, not merged or released, checked 2026-10-19); the `engine` gitlink stays `23034fe` (0.4.2) | 3 | 2 | 2 | **20** | In progress (2026-10-22): #9 merged as 0.5.0; engine v0.6.0 (AKAZE seeding, OpenCV 4.14) released; the pin bump to v0.6.0 is `chore/engine-0.6.0` (`-5` read as no seed, `RunStop.SeedFailed`; the metrics array keeps 23 slots, slot 23 unread). The `.dat` and GIF oracles are JVM fixtures that call no engine and pass unchanged (2677 unit tests, 2026-10-22). Left: `HotPathMicroBenchmark` and the 4557 solves/s floor on the Pixel 6 (with TD-212). The original action, for reference: numerics move, so the `.dat` and GIF oracles (`app/src/test/resources/oracles/`) are re-captured there as a reviewed decision (CONTEXT invariants), with `HotPathMicroBenchmark` and the 4557 solves/s floor re-checked, and the app's reading of the metrics array checked for the added slot |
| TD-309 | Ops / backend | `NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM` (`backend/app/config.py:334`), the sender TD-295's new-device mail needs, is not in `deploy-backend.yml`'s `env_vars` block (`.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml:321-347`; `NOTIFY_FROM` at `:329`), so no workflow deploy sets it and the mail stays off (`notify._enabled`, `backend/app/notify.py:57-58`; [ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md) says so). No Resend sender for it is known to be verified (not checked live) | 2 | 1 | 1 | **15** | Open, at deploy. Add `NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM=${{ vars.NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM }}` to the block (empty keeps the mail off), verify the sender in Resend, then set the repo variable ([DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md](DEPLOY_CHECKLIST_2026-10.md) §0). Acceptance: on staging, a new device mails its holder once and a re-registration of it none. Workflow part done in `a02ef2f`: `NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM=${{ vars.NOTIFY_SECURITY_FROM }}` (`.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml:332`), empty keeps the mail off (`backend/app/notify.py:58`). Left **at deploy**: verify a Resend sender, set the repo variable, and check on staging that a new device mails its holder once |
| TD-312 | App / CI | The unit-test JVM sometimes exits part-way with no failing test: Gradle says only "Process 'Gradle Test Executor 1' finished with non-zero exit value 1" and the suite stops early (171-238 of ~385 result files written). Seen 2026-10-19 on #453 (`firebase-bom` 34.19.0 → 35.0.2, `gradle/libs.versions.toml:11`) in 2 of its 3 Tier 1 runs, before and after `main` was merged into it, and once on material_testing (full_ci on `dd47f985`); `main` at the same code without the bump passed every Tier 1 that day. TD-199 had the same message from a full heap and raised the worker to 2 GB (`app/build.gradle.kts:317`), but nothing in these logs names a cause. Diagnostics added: the worker writes a heap dump on an OutOfMemoryError, its error file on a crash and a GC log into `app/build/test-crash/` (`app/build.gradle.kts`, `test.jvmArgs`), and Tier 1 prints them on a failure with the last test classes to finish and the end of the worker's output (`scripts/ci_test_crash_report.py`, step "Report what ended the unit-test JVM" in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | 3 | 2 | 2 | **20** | Open, watch. The diagnostics merged in #459 (`eeaaeb5`); #453 then ran three Tier 1s in a row on `77ebc10` (its PR run and full_ci runs 39326760336 and 39329773513) with no worker exit and merged (`9992576`), so the cause was not observed. The next exit prints its cause in Tier 1's "Report what ended the unit-test JVM" step: fix it then, and close this. Close it unwatched if 20 more Tier 1 runs on `main` pass without one |
| TD-313 | App / CI | CI's instrumented tests do not call the backend with the CI test account. Tier 3 passes `FIREBASE_TEST_EMAIL` / `FIREBASE_TEST_PASSWORD` to the emulator run (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:544-545`, `:562-563`), and their one reader signs in to Firebase and stops at an ID token and its refresh (`app/src/androidTest/java/com/sempermechanics/semper/auth/FirebaseAuthIntegrationTest.kt:50-71`): no `/v1/me`, `/v1/config`, device registration or upload runs against a backend in CI. Since [ADR-027](../adr/ADR-027-test-accounts.md) the CI login can be a staff test account (`purpose: "ci"`) with an approved account and a licence (`backend/app/services/testaccounts.py:72-107`; runbook: OPERATING_MANUAL.md Appendix E, `scripts/create_ci_firebase_account.sh --store`), so it could. Left out of the change on purpose: a CI run against a live backend needs a decision on which environment (staging), its URL as a build input (debug builds boot local-only unless `SEMPER_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false`), and test data that the expiry job and an end must not race | 3 | 2 | 3 | **15** | Open. Wire Tier 3 to staging with the CI test account (the two secrets above, plus the staging API base URL as a variable), add one signed-in round trip (config, register, a small upload, erase), then close |
| TD-314 | Backend / console | A test account's phone cannot be released on its own: once it is active on `maxDevices` phones for an app, the only way to give QC a new phone is to end the account and create another (`DELETE /v1/admin/test-accounts/{uid}`; the device-release route is for Demo accounts, `backend/app/routers/admin.py:100-128`), which also erases its sessions ([ADR-027](../adr/ADR-027-test-accounts.md)) | 2 | 1 | 2 | **12** | Open. Add `POST /v1/admin/test-accounts/{uid}/devices/{deviceId}/release` (fresh staff step-up, audited, no hold) and a Release action per device on the console's Test accounts card. Acceptance: a full test account frees one phone and registers a new one without losing its sessions |
| TD-316 | Ops / deploy | `scripts/deploy-firestore.sh indexes` cannot deploy to the live database with the Firebase CLI on the operator's machine (13.35.1). The four live composite indexes carry `density: SPARSE_ALL` and an explicit `__name__` field; the CLI did not match them to the file's entries (`backend/firestore.indexes.json`), reported them as "not present in your firestore indexes file", tried to create the `sessions` one again and stopped on HTTP 409 "index already exists" before creating anything (2026-10-22). The script names no CLI version (`scripts/deploy-firestore.sh:12`, `:50`). That deploy's two missing composites went in with `gcloud firestore indexes composite create` and the `seats.uid` / `deleted_seats.uid` collection-group overrides with a REST `PATCH …/fields/uid?updateMask=indexConfig`, since `gcloud firestore indexes fields update --index` takes no query scope ([CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), 2026-10-22) | 2 | 2 | 1 | **20** | Open. Find a CLI version that matches the live indexes (dry run against them), pin it in the script (`npx firebase-tools@<version>`) and say so in its header; until then, add a missing index by hand as in that entry and never re-run with `--force` |

## Deferred by design

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Auth-gated UI E2E | `FirebaseAuthIntegrationTest` signs the CI test account in on Tier 3 (TD-200), but through the SDK: no test drives the sign-in screens against real Firebase, and one that did would need the emulator's keyboard and the email-link flow's mailbox |
| `StartupTimingMetric` benchmarks on an API 37 emulator | `startActivityAndWait` confirms launches through `dumpsys gfxinfo framestats`, which is empty there for every activity. `StartupBenchmark` / `ScreenBenchmark` need a phone or an older image (a Pixel 6 on API 37 works: [perf/startup.md](../perf/startup.md)); `ViewerScrubBenchmark` avoids the API and runs |
| Float16 / ZNSSD quantisation for field data | Would change reported numbers; rejected under the bit-exactness requirement |
| In-memory X/Y compaction (derive coordinates from the grid) | Lossless and worth about 25 %, but a larger change that also touches the native writer: the `.dat` stores X and Y for every point (`field/DicResult.kt:20-24`) |

## Checked by hand, not from the repository

These are read with `gh` or `gcloud`, not from the code. On 2026-10-08 none of
them held:

- **API-key restrictions:** the Firebase keys on both projects are limited to a
  list of APIs, but have no Android package / SHA or referrer limits. Owned by TD-222.
- **GitHub Environment branch rules:** no environment, `production` included, has
  a deployment branch policy. Production deploys only from `main` because the
  workflow checks it. Owned by TD-228.

The open checkboxes are in [PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_GATE.md).

## Perf and quality gates (do not loosen)

See [../../engine/docs/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md](../../engine/docs/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md):
≥ 4557 solves/s on the host, the smoke and DICe floors, and `-O3 -ffast-math` / OpenMP /
LTO kept on the release pipeline. **No CI job in this repository enforces the
solve-rate floor:** it is checked by hand in the engine repo when the `engine` pin
moves. `koverVerify` (lines 75, branches 57, `app/build.gradle.kts:460-465`) runs in CI
tier 1, `ciReleaseGate` and the release workflow.

The CI benchmark job ("Benchmarks (macro + micro)") is emulator **smoke**, with no
numeric thresholds. Macrobenchmark suppresses `EMULATOR,LOW-BATTERY,UNLOCKED`.
`HotPathMicroBenchmark` suppresses
`EMULATOR,DEBUGGABLE,LOW-BATTERY,UNLOCKED,ACTIVITY-MISSING,NOT-AOT-COMPILED`
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml:937`, `:939`). Keep API 34: API 37's
`dumpsys gfxinfo framestats` is empty. Run it with the `run_benchmark` dispatch
input or the `benchmark` label.
