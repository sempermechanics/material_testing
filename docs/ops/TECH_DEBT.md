# Tech debt

Program status: **cleared**.

- `app/lint-baseline.xml` and `app/detekt-baseline.xml` are empty.
- `./gradlew :app:lintDebug` reports **no errors**; the gate fails on errors, and
  `lintVitalRelease` is clean. It does report a handful of long-standing warnings
  (`OldTargetApi`, `UnclosedTrace`, `PluralsCandidate`, `TooManyViews`, `UseKtx`) —
  see the note under the 2026-08-12 entry.
- Inherent size/complexity in a few UI orchestration files uses targeted
  `@file:Suppress` — prefer extracting over widening those lists.
- Catalog version-availability lint IDs are disabled; bump deps in deliberate PRs.

## External / deferred (not blocked on code alone)

| Item | Why deferred |
|------|----------------|
| Auth-gated UI E2E | Needs Firebase secrets / fixtures in CI |
| Kover `minBound` raise | Measure stable % on CI first (local AGP 9 often reports no coverage) |
| firebase-admin 7.x | Held with cryptography **44.0.0**; bump as a pair after verifying train |

## Perf / quality gates (do not loosen)

See [../engine/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md](../engine/PERF_BASELINE_bd44af0.md):
≥ 4557 solves/s host; smoke/DICe floors; preserve `-O3 -ffast-math` / OpenMP / LTO
on the release pipeline.

## 2026-08-12 result-viewer / report memory & latency program

Two rounds cutting per-point duplication and per-frame main-thread work in the viewer,
report and export paths. Every change was representation / allocation / threading /
resolution only — computed numbers are bit-identical (GIF bytes byte-identical), pinned
by 0-delta parity tests. Measured before/after, including the drawbacks, is in
[../perf/round2-main-vs-branch.md](../perf/round2-main-vs-branch.md).

**Fixed**

- Report/summary/heatmap collectors de-boxed onto reused primitive buffers; the GIF LZW
  string table is a flat `IntArray` instead of a per-pixel-boxing `HashMap`. Measured
  −99.6 % to −100 % allocations on those paths.
- `.dat` decode is memory-mapped (`decodeDatFile`); export sites no longer read the whole
  file into a second `ByteArray` first.
- Stats-strip and Max/Min extrema moved off the main thread and memoised per (frame, field).
- Viewer look-ahead is now byte-bounded and filled by a single serialized worker, and the
  whole-batch summary scan starts on demand — see the invariants in
  [../app/ARCHITECTURE.md](../app/ARCHITECTURE.md#memory--failure-invariants). Max heap
  during a 150-frame scrub went 165 MB → 24.5 MB and is now flat in workload size.

**Open / deliberately not done**

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| `StartupTimingMetric` benchmarks on an API 37 emulator | `startActivityAndWait` confirms launches via `dumpsys gfxinfo framestats`, which returns empty there for every activity. `StartupBenchmark`/`ScreenBenchmark` need a physical device or an older image; `ViewerScrubBenchmark` avoids the API and runs |
| `UnclosedTrace` in `AnalysisViewModel` (:354, :739) | Pre-existing: `Trace.beginSection` spans a suspension point, so the section can close on another thread. Real but untouched by this program — fix with a non-suspending wrapper, deliberately |
| Float16 / ZNSSD quantisation for field data | Would change reported numbers; rejected under the bit-exactness requirement |
| In-memory X/Y compaction (derive coords from the grid) | Loss-less and worth ~25 %, but a larger change that also touches the native writer |

Long-standing lint warnings above are all pre-existing and none are errors; they are
tracked here rather than baselined so they stay visible.

## 2026-08-05 transparency / robustness audit

A whole-app + backend pass for silent failures, crashes, security and tech debt.
The branch was already strong; findings and fixes were small:

- **Crash guards (fixed).** The JNI full-field solve reads its direct output buffer
  back by the engine's returned point count. Added a bound: a count exceeding the
  ROI-grid buffer capacity is now treated as an engine failure instead of reading
  past the buffer (`AnalysisViewModel`, `VsgStudyRunner`). Closes the residual
  "JNI buffer" concern from the earlier Tier-0 list.
- **Fragile null-asserts (fixed).** `ShareCenter` replaced nine `snap!!` sites with
  a checked `requireSnapshot()` that fails the share job cleanly (snackbar) rather
  than NPE-crashing.
- **Silent restore failure (fixed).** A background restore that failed terminally
  was never surfaced; `SettingsActivity` now observes the `restore` work tag and
  shows the reason, mirroring the existing upload-failure surfacing on Home.
- **Verified clean (no change):** cleartext disabled, no local token storage, no
  hardcoded secrets, release signing wired to an env keystore, backend Drive query
  escaping + `parents` confused-deputy guard, and no PII in Crashlytics WARN/ERROR
  breadcrumbs (`CrashReportingTree`).

## History

Earlier burn-down (CI path filters, Hilt removal, engine Path A–C split, OkHttp 5,
FastAPI train, Analysis helpers, Kover floor 15, UseKtx/Plurals/Overdraw, etc.)
is in git history — do not re-open closed items without new evidence.
