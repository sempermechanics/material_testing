# Sign-in setup (Firebase Authentication)

Identity is federated through **Firebase Authentication**. The app signs the
user in with Firebase, sends the resulting **Firebase ID token** as a bearer
token, and Cloud Run verifies it with `firebase-admin`.

Three providers are wired in
[`AuthRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/rafad/indicvisiondic/data/AuthRepository.kt):

| Provider | How it signs in | Email verified? |
|---|---|---|
| **Google** | Credential Manager returns a Google ID token, exchanged for a Firebase credential ([GoogleSignInHelper.kt](../../app/src/main/java/com/rafad/indicvisiondic/ui/auth/GoogleSignInHelper.kt)) | Yes, by construction |
| **Email link** | Firebase emails a sign-in link; tapping it completes sign-in | Yes, by construction |
| **Email + password** | Standard Firebase email/password | Not until the user confirms |

Sign-in works without any backend: cloud *sync* is what needs
`INDIC_API_BASE_URL`.

## 1. Firebase project

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), open (or
   create) the project — currently `indicvision-dic-app-auth`.
2. **Authentication → Sign-in method**: enable **Google**, **Email/Password**,
   and **Email link (passwordless sign-in)**.
3. **Project settings → Your apps → Android app** with package
   `com.rafad.indicvisiondic`. Add the **SHA-1** of every signing key you use —
   debug and release. Google sign-in fails without it.

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
     -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```

4. Download **`google-services.json`** into `app/`. The
   `com.google.gms.google-services` Gradle plugin reads it and generates the
   `default_web_client_id` string resource that Credential Manager uses — this
   is why no OAuth client ID lives in `local.properties`.

> Adding the SHA-1 in Firebase creates the matching Android OAuth client in the
> underlying Google Cloud project automatically. You do not need to create
> OAuth clients by hand.

## 2. Backend — which project's tokens to accept

The Cloud Run service verifies that a token's audience is a Firebase project
id. Set **one** env var (see [BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md](BACKEND_SETUP_GCP.md)):

- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` — the Firebase project from step 1. Defaults to
  `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, so you only need it when Firebase Auth lives in a
  different project than the backend (e.g. org policy blocks adding Firebase to
  the main one).

There is no client secret and no OAuth code exchange anywhere — the backend is
purely a verifier.

## 3. Who gets in

Verification proves *who* someone is. Whether they may use the system is a
separate decision made in `get_or_create_user`
([firestore_repo.py](../../backend/app/firestore_repo.py)):

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated. A **verified** email in this list gets `role=admin` and is always approved |
| `AUTO_APPROVE_HD` | A **verified** email at this domain is created `APPROVED` |
| `AUTO_APPROVE` | `1` = every new user is created `APPROVED`. Pilot convenience; turn off for production |

Anyone else is created `PENDING` and lands on the approval screen until an
admin approves them via `POST /v1/admin/users/{uid}/approve`. Auto-approval
always requires a verified email, so a fresh email/password signup cannot
self-approve into a privileged domain.

> **There is no domain restriction on *signing in*, deliberately.** Any account
> Firebase Auth accepts can authenticate — that is what lets an outside
> collaborator sign in and land in the approval queue. The control that holds
> is the `PENDING`/`APPROVED` status above. An `ALLOWED_HD` setting that no
> code read used to sit in `config.py`; it has been removed, so don't go
> looking for it.

## 4. App config — local.properties

```properties
INDIC_API_BASE_URL=https://indic-api-xxxx.a.run.app
```

That is the only key the app needs, exposed as
`BuildConfig.INDIC_API_BASE_URL`. Leave it blank to run fully offline with
cloud sync disabled. Rebuild after changing it.

## Testing notes

- Use a **Google APIs / Play Store** emulator image. Plain AOSP images have no
  Play services and the credential sheet fails with `NoCredentialException`.
- Add at least one Google account to the emulator (Settings → Accounts).
- A first-time user is `PENDING` unless one of the rules in §3 applies, so
  expect the "Approval Pending" screen.

## Flow summary

```
Sign in (Google / email link / password)
   └─ Firebase Auth → Firebase ID token
        └─ GET /v1/me  (Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>)
             └─ firebase-admin verifies signature, exp, iss, aud == project id
                  └─ user row ensured in Firestore (PENDING on first sign-in)
                       └─ APPROVED → Home · PENDING → Approval Pending screen
```
