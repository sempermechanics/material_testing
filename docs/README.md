# Semper documentation

Start with the [project README](../README.md) for what Semper is and how to
build it. This page routes you to the rest.

Nothing in `backend/` is needed to build, run, or contribute to the app — the
analysis engine is entirely on-device and offline.

## How the docs are organized

```
docs/
  app/       Android UI layer — Activity flow, packages, session layout
  engine/    the app-facing engine contract, plus stubs into the submodule's own docs
  backend/   the optional GCP cloud side — architecture, setup, sign-in
  legal/     privacy policy and terms — the source the hosted pages are generated from
  ops/       running the project — CI, releases, environments, tech debt, readiness gate, changelog
  adr/       architecture decision records
  perf/      measured before/after reports backing performance changes
  design/    UI wireframes kept as reference for a redesign in flight
```

`docs/engine/` is mostly signposts: the engine lives in its own repository, and
its architecture, math and test docs are canonical at `native/docs/`. The one
real document here is
[engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md](engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md), which states what
the app is allowed to assume across the JNI boundary.

## DIC in five minutes

Digital Image Correlation measures deformation from photographs:

1. A specimen is painted with a random **speckle pattern**.
2. A **reference** photo is taken, then more photos while it deforms.
3. The image is divided into small windows called **subsets** (41×41 px by
   default). Subset widths are always odd — a subset is indexed around its
   center pixel.
4. For each subset the engine finds where it moved in the deformed image, to
   ~1/100th of a pixel, using **ICGN**: an iterative Gauss-Newton solver that
   minimizes **ZNSSD**, a difference score immune to lighting changes (lower is
   better; ≤ 0.15 is accepted).
5. Displacements (**U** horizontal, **V** vertical, in pixels) are
   differentiated into **strains** (**Exx**, **Eyy**, **Exy**) — how much the
   material stretched and sheared.

That is enough theory for most contributions. The full pipeline — AKAZE feature
seeding → Delaunay mesh → RGDIC propagation → ICGN refinement → VSG strain — is
in `native/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` inside the engine submodule.

## Terms you'll meet in the code

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `subset` | The small pixel window being tracked (`SubsetData`). Odd width, always |
| `step` | Grid spacing between tracked points, in px |
| `corr` / ZNSSD | Match quality. 0 = perfect, > 0.15 = rejected, < 0 = failed-point sentinel |
| `ICGN` | The iterative sub-pixel solver (`OptimizationEngine`) |
| `RGDIC` | Reliability-guided propagation — solved points seed their neighbors |
| `VSG` / strain window | Least-squares plane fit over neighboring points that turns displacement into strain. The window is a count of data points (odd); the VSG is the distance it covers, `(window − 1) × step + 1` px |
| `.dat` files | Binary results: 8 floats per point (x, y, u, v, exx, eyy, exy, znssd) |

For the directory layout, see [Where — repository map](../README.md#where--repository-map)
in the project README — it is maintained in one place so the two cannot drift.

## Conventions

- UI strings belong in `strings.xml`, never hardcoded.
- Shared intent keys live in `DicKeys.kt`; binary-format constants in
  `DicResult.kt`.
- Engine changes happen in the engine repository and must keep `dic_tests`
  green there. Results must stay inside the tolerance contract in
  [engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md](engine/ENGINE_APP_CONTRACT.md); if a change
  legitimately moves results, say so explicitly and update the contract on both
  sides.
- Lint and detekt baselines are empty — new findings fail CI. Size and
  complexity findings are silenced per file with `@file:Suppress` (81 files as
  of 2026-09-23); prefer extracts over widening those lists.
- Run `./gradlew spotlessApply` before pushing.
