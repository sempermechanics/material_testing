# Semper operating manual

How to get displacement and strain fields out of a DIC image set, using the app.

<!-- **For:** a graduate researcher who knows DIC basics — subsets, correlation,
strain fields — and has not used this app.

**Not covered:** speckle patterning, lighting, cameras, rigs, calibration and
how to choose test parameters. Those are experiment questions. Use *A Good
Practices Guide for Digital Image Correlation* (iDICs). This manual starts once
you have images. -->

## 1. What it does

You give it one reference frame and N deformed frames. It matches subsets on a
grid and returns five fields per frame.

![Pipeline](images/pipeline.svg)

| Field | Unit |
|---|---|
| **U**, **V** — displacement | px |
| **Exx**, **Eyy**, **Exy** — strain | mε (millistrain) |

Two things to know up front:

- **Displacements are in pixels.** There is no scale calibration. Convert to
  physical units yourself.
- **Everything runs on the phone.** Cloud backup stores results only.

## 2. Getting in

Accounts need approval, not just sign-up.

1. Sign in with Google or email.
2. **Passwords** need 8+ characters with upper and lower case, a digit and a
   special character. **Generate secure password** fills a strong one in for you
   and reveals it so you can save it. **Forgot password** mails you a link;
   opening it on this device reopens the app on a set-new-password form, where
   the same rules apply. You never leave the app to reset a password.
3. **Signing up with email?** Creating the account sends a verification link and
   puts you back on the sign-in form with your address still filled in. Open the
   link, then sign in there. Until you do, sign-in is refused and a fresh link is
   sent each time you try.
4. New accounts land on **Pending approval**. Support is emailed automatically
   at this point — you do not have to ask to be noticed.
5. Tap **Request access** if you want to add context. It opens a prefilled
   email; send it.
6. After an admin approves you, tap **Check status**.

**Nothing polls.** The screen never updates on its own. Use the button.

Google and email-link sign-ins skip step 2 — both already prove the address.

Offline works if you have been approved on this device before. Import, solve and
read results all work without a network. Uploads wait.

**Crash reports are opt-in.** After the beta notice on first run the app asks
once whether it may send crash diagnostics. Nothing is collected unless you say
yes, and you can change your mind at any time under **Settings → Your data →
Send crash reports**.

<img src="images/home.png" width="300" alt="Home screen">

Home lists your analyses. Tap one to open it. Long-press for select, rename,
delete. Pull down to sync. **+** starts a new analysis.

---

## 3. Images it accepts

Hard rules:

| Rule | If broken |
|---|---|
| All frames the same pixel size as the reference | Blocking error; you cannot run |
| At least one reference + one deformed frame | **Next** stays off |
| At most *Max frames* (default 50) | Extras dropped, with a toast |

**Formats.** PNG and TIFF are best. JPEG works but raises an accuracy warning —
compression damages the intensity gradients correlation needs. RAW and DNG
import **only through Files**, not Photos.

**Texture check.** On import the app measures your speckle. Weak pattern → a
warning naming a bigger subset size. Treat it as a comment on the pattern, not
just a setting.

**Video.** Pick a video and a sampling sheet opens: frame rate, time segment,
live frame-count estimate. Frame 0 becomes the reference.

---

## 4. Running an analysis

![Wizard](images/wizard.svg)

### Step 1 — Load frames

<img src="images/step1-frames.png" width="300" alt="Step 1 with three deformed frames loaded">

Tap each dropzone and pick your images:

<img src="images/new-analysis-source.png" width="300" alt="The New analysis sheet">

The **New analysis** sheet opens full height on an **Images** tab — your device's
gallery, three columns, with videos badged so you can tell them apart. For about
1 second the grid is dimmed behind a large centred hint so you read "Select
the reference image" before tiles unlock. Tapping the **Files** tab hands you to the
system file browser instead; that is still the only route to RAW and DNG. Picking
deformed frames is multi-select: tap the tiles you want and confirm with
**Use N**. Select-all lives in the three-dot menu.

The sheet asks for media permission the first time the Images tab needs it:

<img src="images/media-picker-permission-empty.png" width="300" alt="Media picker permission empty state">

The Files tab needs no permission at all, so a phone that denies gallery access
can still work entirely through Files — it opens the system file browser:

<img src="images/media-picker-files-saf.png" width="300" alt="Files tab opening the system file browser">

The strip shows the deformed frames with order badges.

**The badge order is the analysis order.** Frame 1 here is frame 1 everywhere
after. Tap the sort icon to change it:

<img src="images/frame-order-menu.png" width="300" alt="Frame order menu">

| Sort | Use when |
|---|---|
| Name · A–Z / Z–A | Filenames carry the sequence |
| Date · oldest / newest first | Filenames don't; uses capture time, then EXIF |
| Manual | Neither works — drag the thumbnails |

You cannot get back to the picker's original order once sorted. With one
deformed frame the control is hidden.

### Step 2 — Settings

<img src="images/step2-parameters.png" width="300" alt="Step 2 parameters">

Three decisions:

- **Region of interest** — defaults to the full image. **Edit** opens the editor
  ([§6](#6-region-of-interest)).
- **Single setting** or **Parameter sweep** — Single solves every frame once. A
  parameter sweep solves one frame many times ([§7](#7-parameter-sweeps)).
- **Advanced parameters** — [§5](#5-parameters). If you copied a set of
  parameters from a sweep lattice, a **Paste params** chip appears here and fills
  all three in one tap.

Then **Compute**.

### While it runs

<img src="images/running.png" width="300" alt="Progress dialog">

**# converged** and **convergence** update live. **Cancel** stops the run
where it is, within a moment — it does not wait out the frame being solved.
Nothing is kept. Back is blocked. Cancelling a parameter sweep abandons the whole
sweep, not just the combination in flight.

The same overlay covers importing frames and extracting video, but there it
counts frames instead: the two compute tiles are hidden, because nothing is being
solved yet. Cancelling an import asks for confirmation and leaves nothing behind.

**A run stops itself if the images decorrelate.** Two consecutive frames below
50% convergence end it — the frames after them would be no better, and the
message names the frame and image it gave up on.

This is a **short run, not a failed one**: the frames solved before the collapse
are real data, they are saved as an analysis, and acknowledging the message takes
you straight into them. A 50-frame test that decorrelated at frame 40 still gives
you frames 1–39.

**The reason is kept with the analysis.** Its Home row reads "39 of 50 frames"
followed by why it stopped, and **Settings used** (the ⓘ in the viewer) lists
*Stopped early* and *Frames solved*. You do not have to remember the run — or
have been the person who made it.

**Keep the app open.** A run has no resume. If Android kills the app, the run is
gone.

### After

| Result | You land on |
|---|---|
| Single setting | Result viewer, frame 1 |
| Parameter sweep | Result lattice |
| Some sweep points failed | `N of M skipped` toast, then the lattice |
| Engine failed | A dialog naming the cause, and which frame and image it failed on |
| Every sweep combination failed | The lattice, every node hollow — tap one for its reason. **View** and **Save graph** are disabled |

Re-running the same inputs updates the same analysis. Different inputs make a
new one.

---

## 5. Parameters

Single mode only. Slider or typed field, each with an ⓘ.

| Parameter | Range | Reset to |
|---|---|---|
| Subset size | 15–121, odd | Recommended |
| Step size | 1–30 | 5 |
| Strain window | 5–101, odd | 15 |
| Kernel | 4×4 Bicubic / 6×6 Keys | 4×4 Bicubic |

### Subset and step

![Subset and step](images/subset-step.svg)

The app recommends a subset from **your** reference image, using the SSSIG model
of Pan et al. (Opt. Express 16(10), 2008): displacement error scales as
1/√SSSIG, so it grows the subset until the gradient content clears the threshold
for 0.007 px accuracy, sampled on a 4×4 grid and taken as the median.

It is a starting point. Touch the slider and it stops tracking the image.
**Reset** brings it back.

### Strain window and VSG

![Virtual strain gauge](images/vsg.svg)

```
VSG = (strain window − 1) × step + 1     [px]
```

Quote the VSG, not the window: it is the distance one strain value actually
covers. The sweep varies the **window** and reports the resulting VSG per node —
the window is the knob, the VSG is the number you publish.

### Kernel

Sub-pixel interpolation. Leave it on 4×4 Bicubic unless interpolation bias is
your subject.

### Max frames

In Settings, not here. 10–150, default 50. Caps frames per analysis.

---

## 6. Region of interest

<img src="images/roi-editor.png" width="300" alt="ROI editor">

**Draw** — pick Rect or Square, drag on the image. Drag inside to move, corners
to resize. The HUD gives size and position live.

**Manual** — type X, Y, W, H and Apply.

**Crop / Erase** — Crop sets the area to correlate. Erase punches holes in it,
for grips, fiducials or anything that will decorrelate. Add as many as you need.

| Button | Does |
|---|---|
| **Save ROI** | Keeps it, returns to step 2 |
| **Use full image** | Saves the whole frame |
| **Reset** | Clears the canvas |
| **Cancel** | Discards — back to full image |

An ROI smaller than the subset will not run.

---

## 7. Parameter sweeps

### Why

Strain is a derivative, so its size depends on how much you smooth. Small VSG:
peak strain rises, noise rises. Large VSG: peak gets flattened. A sweep shows
where your answer stops depending on the setting — the convergence argument the
Good Practices Guide asks for (Tip 5.4).

A sweep uses **one** deformed frame.

### Setting it up (step 3)

<img src="images/step3-sweep.png" width="300" alt="Sweep setup, step 3">

| Control | Range |
|---|---|
| Subset range | 15–121, odd |
| Strain window range | 5–101, odd — min and max, the sweep's y axis |
| Step denominator | 2–9 — step is `subset ÷ n`, never below 1 px |
| Samples | 1–8 per axis |
| Frame to sweep | radio list + number + preview |

Runtime is the product of the two sample counts. 8 × 8 is 64 solves. Start at
3 × 3.

The sweep varies the **strain window** directly, not the VSG. VSG is still what
you quote — it is shown per node and in the settings sheet — but it is derived
(`(window − 1) × step + 1`), so two combinations with different steps can share a
window and land on different VSGs. Sweeping the window is what makes the axis
mean one thing.

The lattice preview on this step is **inert** — taps do nothing until it has
run. The coach mark points it out on a first visit.

### Reading the result lattice

![Lattice](images/lattice.svg)

<img src="images/result-lattice.png" width="300" alt="Result lattice">

| | |
|---|---|
| Filled dot | Solved. All solved nodes share one colour; the focused one gains a ring |
| Hollow red ring | Skipped — tap it and the reason names the combination and what went wrong |

Colour on the plot below is reserved for the focused curve, so only one hue
ever carries meaning at a time.

The screen is built to be worked with one thumb. It scrolls — summary line,
lattice, controls, then plot — while **Save graph** and **View** stay pinned at
the bottom. The y axis is the **strain window**; the lattice draws compact, so
the coach mark on first visit is what names the axes.

**Choosing a combination**

- **Tap** a node, or use the **‹ · ›** stepper above the plot to walk the solved
  nodes in order. The chip between the arrows names the current one.
- **Double-tap** or **long-press** a node — opens that result. So does **View**.
- Tapping a hollow node explains why that combination was skipped.

**Reading the plot**

- The **All / Node** pill above the plot chooses how much is drawn. **All** is
  the default: every combination, the focused one at full strength in colour and
  the rest sharing one muted neutral. **Node** narrows it to the focused
  combination alone.
- **Drag across the plot** — a guide follows your finger, a dot marks the curve
  and the value is printed beside it. The **slider** under the plot does the same
  thing and stays in sync with the drag, which is easier one-handed.
- The readout under the plot shows `x=…  y=…` for one unmuted curve, or `x=…`
  plus each `label=value` when **All** is showing several series.
- **Pinch to zoom**, **two-finger drag** to pan, **double-tap** to reset. The
  zoom survives stepping to another node; changing component resets it, because
  Exx, Eyy and Exy differ in magnitude.
- The **Exx / Eyy / Exy** selector switches component.

**Taking the answer with you**

- **Double-tap or long-press the parameter chip** to copy that combination's
  subset, step and strain window. Start a new single-setting analysis and a **Paste params** chip on
  step 2 fills them in — this is how you go from "the sweep says 41 · 5 · 15" to
  running the whole batch at it.
- **Save graph** writes a PNG and hands it straight to the system share sheet —
  it is the one export that does not go through **Send to**. The file carries a
  header naming the study, the reference image and deformed count, and the
  focused combination's parameters (plus the combination count when the plot is
  showing **All**); the plot; and a single-column colour legend. It is rendered fit-to-data, so your
  on-screen zoom neither leaks into the file nor is disturbed by saving.

Look for the VSG where the curves stop separating.

## 8. Reading results

<img src="images/result-viewer.png" width="300" alt="Result viewer">

Field pills switch field. Pinch to zoom (~10×), drag to pan; both survive a
field change. Double-tap zooms or resets. A horizontal fling while fit-to-screen
steps frames. Chrome auto-hides after a short idle; pan or scrub brings it back,
and so does a tap in the middle of the screen or a downward swipe. The figure
itself runs edge to edge, under the system bars. The ⓘ sheet holds the specimen
name, max / min (with coordinates), mean, and the settings used for this
analysis.

**Colour scale.** Default is a **clamp at this frame's 2nd and 98th percentiles**,
which is why the hairline reads "≤" and "≥" rather than "Min"/"Max" — a handful of
outliers must not flatten the whole map. The ⓘ sheet still gives you the true
extrema, and the two are allowed to disagree. Tap the bar to set fixed min/max
(remembered per field). **Auto scale** drops a custom override and returns to the
clamped bounds. The
summary GIF and share field-animations still use a whole-sequence scale so the
loop stays comparable.

**Tap to probe.** There is no Inspect / X,Y / Max-Min row. A short tap on the
heatmap — anywhere but the middle of the screen, which is reserved for showing
and hiding chrome — places a crosshair and a plain-text reading at the nearest
correlated point. Drag past the touch slop pans (or flings to the next frame when
unzoomed); pinch still zooms. Tap the same point again, or the readout, to
dismiss. Switching field or frame keeps the probe at the same image location and
updates the value.

**The summary comes first.** The viewer opens on a looping animation of the
whole sequence in the current field — every frame, never longer than 10 seconds,
about 300 ms a frame until the frame count forces it faster. While it builds you
get a progress readout and a **Cancel**. **Next** enters the
frames; **Prev** on frame 1 comes back to it. Switching field rebuilds it in that
field. Field pills stay available while the GIF plays.

(Animation playback needs Android 9 or newer. Below that you get the first frame
and a note; the GIFs still export.)

**Frames.** Prev / Next step through; the counter shows the filename and
`(i / N)`. Type a number in the small field under it and press Go to jump
straight to that frame — useful at 150 frames. Anything out of range leaves you
where you are. On a sweep each frame is a parameter combination, labelled like
`S15 · St5 · W13 · VSG 61`.

### Settings used

<img src="images/settings-used.png" width="300" alt="Settings used sheet">

The ⓘ button. Everything the result was computed with — and on a sweep, the
line-cut plot. There is no separate VSG row: it is `(strain window − 1) × step + 1`,
and both of those are already listed, so `(13 − 1) × 5 + 1 = 61 px` is yours to
read off (the relation is in [§5](#5-parameters)). A run that stopped early also
carries **Stopped early** and **Frames solved** here.

**Changing settings later never changes an old result.** This sheet is your
provenance record.

---

## 9. Exports

**Share** gives six targets. Each ends at a **Send to** sheet with two rows:
**Save to Files** (a folder picker, so it lands somewhere you choose and stays) or
**Share** (the usual system chooser). For everything but the single photo the
sheet comes up **first**, so the file is written straight into the folder you
picked instead of being staged and handed over. Exports are named after the
analysis, so a folder of them is still readable a month later. A long export does
not hold the screen: dismiss the progress dialog and it carries on behind a strip
at the top, with its own progress and a Cancel.

| Export | Contents |
|---|---|
| Single Field | One PNG: current field and frame, annotated, composited to a 1280 px long edge |
| All fields | Five PNGs for this frame, zipped; the sheet and each stamp name the source image |
| Animations | Five looping GIFs — one per field, every frame, each on its own whole-sequence scale — zipped |
| PDF report | Every frame, plus a telemetry page |
| CSV data | `image,x_px,y_px,u_px,v_px,exx,eyy,exy,znssd` — a sweep adds `subset_px, step_px, strain_window, vsg_px` |
| Everything (.zip) | Raw photos + animations + all fields + CSV + PDF |

The animations are shared as a set, not one at a time — they are only comparable
because they share a scale, and the set is what carries that.

Build on the **CSV**. Coordinates are image pixels, displacements pixels,
strains scientific notation. `znssd` is the match residual — filter on it to drop
badly correlated points. Number formatting is locale-independent.

For a paper, export **Everything** and keep it with your raw images. Inputs,
fields and parameters in one archive is what makes the result reproducible.

---

## 10. Managing analyses

Long-press a row to select. Pencil renames (one row only), bin deletes.

<img src="images/home-selection.png" width="300" alt="Selection mode">

**What delete does depends on whether there is a cloud copy.** With none, it
goes from the phone and that is that:

<img src="images/delete-dialog.png" width="300" alt="Delete confirmation">

With a backup you are asked *where* instead — **Delete device**, keeping the
backup, or **Delete cloud**, keeping the phone's copy. Read that dialog before
tapping.

**Deleting on this device only is not losing it.** The row stays on Home, badged
**Only in cloud**, and tapping it offers to download the analysis back before
opening it. That is the point of the badge: a cloud-backed analysis is one tap
from being local again, so freeing space is a reversible decision.

<img src="images/settings.png" width="300" alt="Settings sections">

**Cloud backup**: turn it on and it offers to back up what is already
local. **Wi-Fi only** holds uploads until Wi-Fi. **Analyses data management**
lists local and cloud together, with three actions per row:

| Action | Does | Shows when |
|---|---|---|
| **Download** | Saves a `Session.zip` to a folder you pick — you choose the destination *before* it starts, and the bytes go straight there | Any row with a cloud copy, including ones already on the phone |
| **Restore** | Pulls the analysis back into the app so it opens normally | Only when the local frames are missing |
| **Delete** | Removes the backup, with a **5-second Undo** | Any row with a backup |

Downloads and restores keep running if you leave Settings, and report back when
they land.

**Storage** is the section to reach for when the phone fills up. It measures what
the analyses and the cache actually occupy, and gives you three tools:

| Control | Does |
|---|---|
| **Free up space** | Drops the local frames of analyses that are already backed up. They become "Only in cloud" rows; nothing un-backed-up is touched |
| **Clear cache** | Removes regenerable files — previews, exports waiting to be shared |
| **Auto-free budget** | A slider, 0 (off) to 64 GB. Set it and the app reclaims space at start-up whenever usage is over the budget, oldest backed-up analyses first |

**Background transfers survive leaving the screen and are honest about failure.**
An upload or restore runs even if you navigate away, showing a system
notification while it works, and — while you are on Home — a progress bar on the
row itself, for downloads as well as uploads. Success is quiet: the badge or list
just updates. A backup that *fails for good* (another device holds the account,
the analysis is too large, or a render ran out of memory) raises a dialog on the
Home badge explaining why, with **Try again**. A restore that fails (the backup
was deleted, or is not this account's) says so on Home *and* in Settings. You are
no longer left guessing.

**Your data** also holds **Send crash reports**. That one switch governs both
crash diagnostics and anonymous product analytics — which screens and actions get
used, in coarse buckets. Neither carries your images, results, specimen names or
addresses, and nothing is sent until you turn it on.

**Your data** holds the two exports and the account delete. **Export my data**
builds a ZIP of everything on this phone; **Download my cloud account data** asks
the server for its copy. Both show progress and finish at the same **Send to**
sheet as any other export.

**Deleting your account** (Settings → Your data) asks you to confirm your
identity first, on the sign-in screen itself — whichever way you normally sign
in: password, Google, or an emailed link. Your address is filled in and cannot be
changed; you are proving *this* account. Back out and nothing happens. Once
confirmed it erases the cloud copy, this device, and the sign-in itself, and
signs you out. If the cloud cannot be reached nothing is deleted at all.

**Quota.** The Home chip reads `Using N of M analyses` and turns red at the cap.
Not a paywall — email support from the limit screen, or delete something and
tap **Re-check**.

**Help & support** is the last section, and it now opens the **Manual** directly
as well. **Send feedback** is for "this could be better" — it opens a mail with
your app version and phone model and nothing else. Prefer the
[Manual](https://semperdic.github.io/website/manual/) for how-to, and the
[community](https://semperdic.github.io/website/community/) for questions, bugs,
and feature requests (GitHub login required to post). The section also shows
`support@indicvision.com` — selectable, so you can copy it if this device has no
mail app — and **Email support**, which opens a mail already carrying your
account, device ID, app version and phone model for private or account issues.
Write above that block; leave it in place.

## 11. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Run blocked, size message | A frame differs in pixel size from the reference |
| **Next** off on step 1 | Missing the reference or all deformed frames |
| "ROI too small" | ROI smaller than the subset — enlarge it or shrink the subset |
| Engine failure: feature detection | The pair could not be correlated. Pattern, or wrong pair |
| Engine failure: ROI | Region too small or fully masked |
| Low-texture warning | Weak speckle for this region |
| Sweep skipped nodes | Those combinations don't fit — usually big subsets in a small ROI. Tap a hollow node for its reason |
| Run stopped itself partway | Convergence fell below 50% twice running — the pair has decorrelated. The message names the frame, and the frames before it are kept |
| Sweep ended early | Same rule: two combinations under 50% and it stops rather than sweep the rest |
| Password rejected on sign-up | 8+ chars, upper and lower case, a digit and a special character — or tap **Generate secure password** |
| Only the first N frames | *Max frames* capped it |
| Frames in the wrong order | Sort on step 1, then re-run |
| Run vanished | The app was killed. No resume — run it again in the foreground |
| Frames look incomparable | Auto colour scale. Fix the bounds, or use the summary animation — it already puts them on one |
| Summary still says "Rendering" | A long analysis takes a while to render five fields; the frames are usable meanwhile |
| Summary shows one frame, not a loop | Android 8 or older. The exported GIFs still animate |
| Delete account opens the sign-in screen | Expected — that is where your identity is confirmed |
| Badge stuck on Pending | Offline, Wi-Fi-only, or backup off |
| Badge shows Failed | Tap it — the dialog names why (device conflict, too large, ran out of memory) and offers **Try again** |
| Restore never arrived | If it failed for good, Home and Settings both show a message saying so; otherwise it retries on a flaky network |
| Row says "Only in cloud" | Its local frames were freed (by you, or by the auto-free budget). Tap it to download them back |
| Phone out of space | **Settings → Storage → Free up space**, and consider setting an auto-free budget |
| Still pending approval | Tap **Check status** — it never polls |
| Sign-in refused after signing up | Open the verification link in your email, then try again |
| Nothing here matches | **Settings → Help & support** — ask the community at [semperdic.github.io/website](https://semperdic.github.io/website/support/), or **Email support** (the mail carries your account, device and build) |

## Appendix C — Administrators

Admin accounts get **Settings → Account → Pending access requests**: everyone
waiting, with **Approve** and **Deny**. Approved users get in when they next tap
**Check status** — they are not notified, so tell them.

You do not have to watch that list. The backend emails `support@indicvision.com`
the moment an account is created pending, naming the account and its user id,
with both ways to approve it. One mail per account, at creation — approving,
denying or signing in again sends nothing further. If no mail arrives, check the
`NOTIFY_FROM` / `RESEND_API_KEY` settings on the service: unconfigured, the
backend sends nothing and says nothing, and the pending list is your only signal.
